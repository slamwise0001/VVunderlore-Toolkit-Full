### *1st-level Conjuration Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 Hour

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
 
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
