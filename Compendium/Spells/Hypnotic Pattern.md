### *3rd-level Illusion Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** S, M

**Duration:** 1 Minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
 
 The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
