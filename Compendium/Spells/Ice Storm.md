### *4th-level Evocation Spell*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 300 ft

**Components:** V, S, M

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
 Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.
 
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
