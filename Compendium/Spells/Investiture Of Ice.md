### *6th-level Transmutation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 Minutes

Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:
 
  You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.
 
  You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.
 
  The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.
 
  You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
