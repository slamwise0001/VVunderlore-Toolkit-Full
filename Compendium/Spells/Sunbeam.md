### *6th-level Evocation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Self (60 ft )

**Components:** V, S, M

**Duration:** 1 Minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
 You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
 
 For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
