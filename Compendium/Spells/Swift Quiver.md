### *5th-level Transmutation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M

**Duration:** 1 Minute

You transmute your quiver s o i t produces a n endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.
