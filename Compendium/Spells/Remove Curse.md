### *3rd-level Abjuration Spell*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
