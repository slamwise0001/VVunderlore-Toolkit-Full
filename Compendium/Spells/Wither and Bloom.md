### *2nd-level Necromancy Spell*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a withered vine twisted into a loop)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke both death and life-giving magic. Choose a point within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical vegetation in that area withers.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area can spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
