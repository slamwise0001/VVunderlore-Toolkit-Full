### *2nd-level Illusion Spell* *(Ritual, Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 120 ft

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 Minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
