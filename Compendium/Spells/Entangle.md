### *1st-level Conjuration Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 90 ft

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 Minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
 
 A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
 
 When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
