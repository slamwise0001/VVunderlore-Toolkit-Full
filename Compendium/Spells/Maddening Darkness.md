### *8th-level Evocation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** 150 ft

**Components:** V, M

**Duration:** 10 Minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60—foot—radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.
 
 Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
