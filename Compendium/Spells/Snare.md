### *1st-level Abjuration Spell*

**Casting Time:** 1 Minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** S, M

**Duration:** 8 Hours

As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
 
 This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.
 
 The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.
 
 A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someâ€” one else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.
 
 After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.
