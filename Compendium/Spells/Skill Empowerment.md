### *5th-level Transmutation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 Hour

Your magic deepens a creature's understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.
 
 You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.
