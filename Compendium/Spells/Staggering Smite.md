### *4th-level Evocation Spell* *(Concentration)*

**Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 Minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
