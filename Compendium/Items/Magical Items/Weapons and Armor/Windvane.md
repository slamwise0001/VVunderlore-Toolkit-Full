# Windvane

*Weapons and Armor, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Air. You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage. Air Mastery. You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane: Song of the Four Winds. While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a {@item devastation orb of air|PotA}. Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn. Flaw. Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me." Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
