# Armor of Vulnerability (Piercing)

*Weapons and Armor, Rare* **Attunement needed.**

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage. **Curse:** This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an {@spell identify} spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to bludgeoning and slashing damage.
