# Tinderstrike

*Weapons and Armor, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for 1d4 minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of {@creature Imix|PotA}, Prince of Evil Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage. Fire Mastery. You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike: Dance of the All-Consuming Fire: While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a {@item devastation orb of fire|PotA}. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn. Flaw. Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
