# Demon Armor

*Weapons and Armor, Very Rare* **Attunement needed.**

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8. **Curse:** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
