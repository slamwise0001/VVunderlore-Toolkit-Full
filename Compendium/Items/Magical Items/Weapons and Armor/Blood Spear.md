# Blood Spear

*Weapons and Armor, Uncommon* **Attunement needed.**

Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting. When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.
