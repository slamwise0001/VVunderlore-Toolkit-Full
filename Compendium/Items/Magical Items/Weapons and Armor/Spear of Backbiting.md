Until the curse is broken with {@spell remove curse} or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back.
