# Robe of Eyes

*Magical Items, Rare* **Attunement needed.**

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits: The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe. A {@spell light} spell cast on the robe or a {@spell daylight} spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for {@spell light} or DC 15 for {@spell daylight}), ending the blindness on a success.
