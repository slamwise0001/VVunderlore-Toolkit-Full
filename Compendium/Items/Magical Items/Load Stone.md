# Load Stone

*Magical Items, Rare*

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp. **Curse:** The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; {@spell detect magic} doesn't detect it. An {@spell identify} spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with {@spell remove curse} or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
