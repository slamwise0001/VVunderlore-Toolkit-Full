# Dust of Sneezing and Choking

*Magical Items, Uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be {@item dust of disappearance}, and an {@spell identify} spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is {@condition incapacitated} and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The {@spell lesser restoration} spell can also end the effect on a creature.
