# Helm of Telepathy

*Magical Items, Uncommon* **Attunement needed.**

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the {@spell detect thoughts} spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply — using a bonus action to do so — while your focus on it continues. While focusing on a creature with {@spell detect thoughts}, you can use an action to cast the {@spell suggestion} spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
