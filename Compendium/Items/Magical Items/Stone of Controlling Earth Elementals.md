# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Magical Items, Rare*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an {@creature earth elemental}, as if you had cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
