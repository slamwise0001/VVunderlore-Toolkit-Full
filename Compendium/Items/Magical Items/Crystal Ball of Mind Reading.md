# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading

*Magical Items, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

This {@item crystal ball} is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the {@spell scrying} spell (save DC 17) with it. You can use an action to cast the {@spell detect thoughts} spell (save DC 17) while you are {@spell scrying} with the {@item crystal ball}, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this {@spell detect thoughts} to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if {@spell scrying} ends.
