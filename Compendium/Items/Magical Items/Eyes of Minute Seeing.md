# Eyes of Minute Seeing

*Magical Items, Uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.
