You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: {@spell cone of cold} (5 charges), {@spell fog cloud} (1 charge), {@spell ice storm} (4 charges), or {@spell wall of ice} (4 charges). The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
