# Horn of Valhalla, Silver

*Magical Items, Rare*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the {@creature berserker} statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. The silver horn summons 2d4+2 berserkers. The berserkers are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
