# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals

*Magical Items, Rare*

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a {@creature fire elemental}, as if you had cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
