# Instrument of the Bards, Fochlucan Bandore

*Magical Items, Uncommon*

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage. You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become {@condition charmed} on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus. All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: {@spell fly}, {@spell invisibility}, {@spell levitate}, and {@spell protection from evil and good}. In addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast {@spell entangle}, {@spell faerie fire}, {@spell shillelagh}, and {@spell speak with animals}.
