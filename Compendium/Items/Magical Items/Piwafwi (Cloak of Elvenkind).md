# Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)

*Magical Items, Uncommon* **Attunement needed.**

This dark spider-silk cloak is made by {@creature drow}. It is a {@item cloak of elvenkind}. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption. While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
