# Cloak of Elvenkind

*Magical Items, Uncommon* **Attunement needed.**

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
