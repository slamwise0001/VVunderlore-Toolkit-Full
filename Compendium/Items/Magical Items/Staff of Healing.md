# Staff of Healing

*Miscellaneous, Rare*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: {@spell cure wounds} (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), {@spell lesser restoration} (2 charges). or {@spell mass cure wounds} (5 charges). The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
