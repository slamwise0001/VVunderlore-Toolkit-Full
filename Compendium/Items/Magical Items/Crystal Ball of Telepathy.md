# Crystal Ball of Telepathy

*Magical Items, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

This {@item crystal ball} is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the {@spell scrying} spell (save DC 17) with it. While {@spell scrying} with the {@item crystal ball}, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the {@spell suggestion} spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if {@spell scrying} ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the {@item crystal ball} can't be used again until the next dawn.
