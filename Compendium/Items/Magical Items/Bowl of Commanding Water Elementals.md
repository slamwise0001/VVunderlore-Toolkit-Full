# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

*Magical Items, Rare*

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a {@creature water elemental}, as if you had cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
