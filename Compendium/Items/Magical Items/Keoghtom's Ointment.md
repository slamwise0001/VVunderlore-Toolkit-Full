# Keoghtom's Ointment

*Magical Items, Uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4+1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh Â½ pound. As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8+2 hit points, ceases to be {@condition poisoned}, and is cured of any disease.
