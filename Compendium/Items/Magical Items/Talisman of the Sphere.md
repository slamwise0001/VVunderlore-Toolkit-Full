# Talisman of the Sphere

*Magical Items, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

When you make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to control a {@item sphere of annihilation} while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a {@item sphere of annihilation}, you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 x your Intelligence modifier.
