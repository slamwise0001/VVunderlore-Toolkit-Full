# Cloak of Invisibility

*Magical Items, Legendary* **Attunement needed.**

While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become {@condition invisible}. While you are {@condition invisible}, anything you are carrying or wearing is {@condition invisible} with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action. Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.
