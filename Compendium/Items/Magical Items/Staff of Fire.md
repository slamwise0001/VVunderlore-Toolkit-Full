# Staff of Fire

*Miscellaneous, Very Rare*

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: {@spell burning hands} (1 charge), {@spell fireball} (3 charges), or {@spell wall of fire} (4 charges). The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
