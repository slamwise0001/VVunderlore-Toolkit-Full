# Efreeti Bottle

*Magical Items, Very Rare*

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an {@creature efreeti} appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls to determine what happens.
