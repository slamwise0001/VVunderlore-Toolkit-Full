# Sovereign Glue

*Magical Items, Legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with {@item oil of slipperiness}. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces. One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of {@item universal solvent} or {@item oil of etherealness}, or with a {@spell wish} spell.
