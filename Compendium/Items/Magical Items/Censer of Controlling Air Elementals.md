# Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

*Magical Items, Rare*

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer's command word and summon an {@creature air elemental}, as if you had cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn. This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
