# Wand of Templating

*Wand, Rare*. **Requires attunement.**

*"Give me a control wand big enough and I could copy/paste the world." _blaZeitKing_, the Wizard of Discordant Communication*

The Wand of Templating allows you to save one mundane object in it's memory and recreate it ad-infinitum but only insofar as you can focus your attention to recreate the RIGHT object in the RIGHT way, despite the memory of the wand. Sometimes you just paste the .

After copying an item, you must wait until the next day to make a replica.

When using the wand to recreate an item, roll a d4. Depending on the roll the copy can be a perfect replica of the original (4) or a sad, nearly unrecognizable copy (1) The description and effectiveness of the mundane object is at the discretion of the GM.

The wand has max 12 charges and regains 1d10 at the start of each day. 
- To recreate an object costs 1 charge.
- To "save" an object in the wand's "clipboard" costs 2 charges.
