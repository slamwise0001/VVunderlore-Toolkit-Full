# Philter of Love

*Consumables, Uncommon*

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become {@condition charmed} by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are {@condition charmed}. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
