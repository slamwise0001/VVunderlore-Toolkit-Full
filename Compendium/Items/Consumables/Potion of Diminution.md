# Potion of Diminution

*Consumables, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the {@spell enlarge/reduce|phb} spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
