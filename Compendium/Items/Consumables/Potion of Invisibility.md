# Potion of Invisibility

*Consumables, Very Rare*

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become {@condition invisible} for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is {@condition invisible} with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
