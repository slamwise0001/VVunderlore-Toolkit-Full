# Assassin's Blood (Ingested)

*Gear, None*

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is {@condition poisoned} for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't {@condition poisoned}.
