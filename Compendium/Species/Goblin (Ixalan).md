## Age
Goblins mature faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 12. They age noticeably faster, and though few goblins live to old age, the most cautious rarely live longer than 50 years.

## Alignment
Most goblins are wildly chaotic, with no particular inclination toward good or evil but a strong tendency toward mischief.

## Agile Climber
You have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You can't use your climbing speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your climbing speed if you are encumbered.)

## Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common (if it exists in your campaign) and Goblin.
