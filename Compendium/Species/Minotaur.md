{@i In 2015, minotaurs appeared as a playtest option in Unearthed Arcana. Here is a revised set of traits for minotaur player characters. These traits are suitable for minotaurs on Krynn and in other D&D worlds where these people have avoided the demonic influence of Baphomet.

## Age
Minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 150 years.

## Alignment
Most minotaurs lean toward lawful alignments.

## Size
Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have strong, stocky builds. Your size is Medium.

## Horns
Your horns are natural melee weapons, with which you're proficient. When you hit with them, the target takes piercing damage equal to 1d6+your Strength modifier.

## Goring Rush
Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least as far as your speed, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

## Hammering Horns
Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to shove that creature with your horns using your reaction. The creature must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. It must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. If it fails, you push it up to 5 feet away from you.

## Menacing
You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

## Hybrid Nature
You have two creature types: humanoid and monstrosity. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.
