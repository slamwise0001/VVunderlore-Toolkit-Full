# Goliath


- **Size**: M

- **Speed**: Walk 30 ft.

## Age
Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.

## Alignment
Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.

## Natural Athlete
You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

## Stone's Endurance
You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Powerful Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

## Mountain Born
You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

## Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.
