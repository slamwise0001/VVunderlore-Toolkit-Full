### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 ({@dice 4d12+7}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the mosasaurus zombie can't bite another target.

***Necrotic Belch (Recharge 6).*** The mosasaurus zombie belches necrotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 4d10}) necrotic damage and becoming blinded for 1 minute on a failure, or taking only half damage on a success.

***Swallow.*** The mosasaurus zombie makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mosasaurus zombie, and it takes 17 ({@dice 5d6}) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mosasaurus zombie's turns.If the mosasaurus zombie takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the mosasaurus zombie must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the mosasaurus zombie. If the mosasaurus zombie dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.
