### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The chelicerae has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Siphon Spell Slots.*** The chelicerae cannot replenish its spells naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell.However, the chelicerae can also draw out spell slots from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. Instead of moving, the chelicerae can inflict {@dice 1d4} Wisdom damage to any creature grappled in its mandibles, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point of damage inflicted. A victim reduced to 0 Wisdom cannot power any more magical abilities. Victims do not heal ability damage or regain spell slots while this grapple is maintained.

***Spider Climb.*** Chelicerae can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without requiring an ability check.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The chelicerae makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+6}) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The target must also make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned this way, the target is unconscious and takes {@dice 1d4} Strength damage at the start of each of its turns. The poisoning ends after 4 rounds or when the target makes a successful DC 16 Constitution save at the end of its turn.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) slashing damage.
