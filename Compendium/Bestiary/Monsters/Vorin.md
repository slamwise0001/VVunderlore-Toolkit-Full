### Traits
***Camouflage.*** A vorin thats submerged in water or mud can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

***Seeping Poison.*** If the target of the vorins spit attack is wearing armor, then the poison needs one round to seep through gaps in the armor and contact the targets skin. The target or an adjacent ally can use an action to make a DC 15 Dexterity check; success indicates the poison was scraped off completely before it penetrated the armor. An edged weapon or tool must be used. Any slashing weapon and most piercing weapons will do the job. Note that only the vorins spit needs to seep through armor; poison from its sting does not.

***Water Breathing.*** A vorin breathes equally well in air or water.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A vorin attacks three times. It spits, then bites, directing both attacks at the same target if it can. It also stings, and that attack can be aimed at any target within reach.

***Spit.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, range 25 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated. An incapacitated creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the incapacitation, but if the saving throw fails, the creature is paralyzed for {@dice 1d4} hours. If the target creature is wearing armor, see Seeping Poison, above.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated. An incapacitated creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the incapacitation, but if the saving throw fails, the creature is paralyzed for {@dice 1d4} hours
