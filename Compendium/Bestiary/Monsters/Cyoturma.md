### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The cyoturma can breathe both air and water.

***Corruption Venom.*** A creature that is subjected to the cyoturma's corruption venom takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution or its hit point maximum is reduced by a number equal to the poison damage taken and it is permanently poisoned. While poisoned, the yellow poison weeps from the creature's facial orifices, wounds and even pores in its skin, the creature is immune to further damage from any cyoturma's corruption venom, and has disadvantage on Charisma checks. If the creature has been poisoned by the corruption venom for 7 days or more, it becomes charmed and must obey any telepathic or verbal command given to it by any obyrith to the best of its ability until the poison is neutralized. Any creature that touches the poisoned creature or the poison is subjected to the cyoturma's corruption venom as well. A creature that touches the poisoned creature while casting a spell that successfully neutralizes the poison does not have to make a saving throw against the poison.

***Magic Resistance.*** The cyoturma has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cyoturma makes three attacks: one with its bite or its venomous touch and two with its fangs.

***Fangs.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@dice 2d8}) necrotic damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 3d8+4}) piercing damage and the target is subjected the cyoturma's corruption venom.

***Venomous Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target is subjected the cyoturma's corruption venom.

***Disgusting Form (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the cyoturma that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute as sheer disgust makes it lose control over its muscles. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
