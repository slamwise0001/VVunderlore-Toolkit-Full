### Traits

***Fear of Fire.*** If the yeti takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
***Keen Smell.*** The yeti has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
***Snow Camouflage.*** The yeti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

***Chilling Gaze.*** The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) cold damage and then be paralyzed for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targetâ€™s saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.
