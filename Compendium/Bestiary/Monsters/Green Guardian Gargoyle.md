### Traits
***Reanimation.*** A green guardian gargoyle that is destroyed will reanimate {@dice 1d8+2 }days later unless its eyes are removed, crushed, and disenchanted by casting both dispel magic (automatic) and greater restoration on them. If the eyes are taken away but not destroyed, they simply disappear from wherever they are and reappear in the green guardian's eye sockets at the moment it reanimates. The same applies to any other body parts that were demolished or removed.

***Stony Appearance.*** While a green guardian gargoyle sits motionless, it can't be detected as a living creature by any means.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A green guardian gargoyle attacks once with claws and gores once with its horns.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d8+2}) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the target is also grappled and restrained.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage.
