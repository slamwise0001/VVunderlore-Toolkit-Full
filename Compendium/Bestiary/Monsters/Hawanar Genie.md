### Traits
***Air Mastery.*** Airborne creatures have tactical disadvantage on attacks against a hawanar.

***Holocone.*** A hawanar can transform into a vortex of embers and white-hot fire as a bonus action and can remain in this form for up to six rounds. Once it changes back to its normal form, it can't resume its holocone form for another 10 minutes. In holocone form, the hawanar genie can move through the air or along any surface at its fly speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures; creatures of Medium size or smaller must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swept into the vortex, taking 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage and being grappled by the genie, which can then move the grappled creature according to the normal grappling rules. The genie can't end its move in the same space as a character it isn't grappling.

***Mobility.*** When a hawanar genie moves, opportunity attacks against it have tactical disadvantage

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A hawanar genie attacks twice with fists or twice with its falchion, or uses a spelllike ability.

***Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage.

***Falchion.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the hawanar's attack roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20.
