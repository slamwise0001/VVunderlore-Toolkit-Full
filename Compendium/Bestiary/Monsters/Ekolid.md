### Traits
***Unnatural Quickness.*** The ekolid may make the dash or disengage action as a bonus action.

***Hatching Offspring.*** At the start of the ekolid's turn, all eggs it implanted with its stings hatch, the emerging grubs dealing 3 ({@dice 1d6}) piercing damage per implanted egg to the creature as they gnaw their way out. Afterward the grubs are harmless. Each grub has AC 10 and 1 hit point and grows into a fully formed Ekolid within {@dice 2d6} hours. The eggs hatch even if the ekolid is dead or otherwise removed from the encounter.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ekolid makes three sting attacks.

***Stings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have an ekolid egg implanted under its skin.

***Skin—Crawling Form (Recharge 5—6).*** Each creature within 10 feet of the ekolid that can see it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or gain disadvantage on ability checks for one minute as it feels like creatures are crawling beneath its skin. While under this effect the creature must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns to maintain concentration on any spells. A creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
