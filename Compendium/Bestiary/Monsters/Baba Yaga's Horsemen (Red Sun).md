### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The horseman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Peerless Rider.*** Any attacks directed at the horseman's mount targets the horseman instead. Its mount gains the benefit of the rider's damage and condition immunities, and if the horseman passes a saving throw against an area effect, the mount takes no damage.

***Quick Draw.*** The horseman can switch between wielding its lance and longsword as a bonus action.

***The Three Horsemen.*** Each horseman has unique senses, defenses, and special abilities.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The horseman makes three attacks with its lance or longsword. It can use Temporal Strike with one of these attacks when it is available.

***Lance.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft. (disadvantage within 5 ft.), one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 1d12+6}) piercing damage.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d8+6}) slashing damage.

***Temporal Strike (Recharge 5â€”6).*** When the horseman strikes a target with a melee attack, in addition to taking normal damage, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or instantly age {@dice 3d10} years. A creature that ages this way has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws based on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the aging is reversed. A creature that ages beyond its lifespan dies immediately. The aging reverses automatically after 24 hours, or it can be reversed magically by greater restoration or comparable magic. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to the temporal strike effect for 24 hours.
