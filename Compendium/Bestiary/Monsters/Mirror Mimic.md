### Traits
***Shapechange.*** The mimic can use its action to polymorph into a Medium creature it has seen at least once or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed but the mimic can imitate the appearance of worn equipment. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

***False Appearance (Disguised Form Only).*** The mimic's apprearance is indistinguishable from the creature it is imitating. It can perfectly imitate the creature's voice and any mannerisms it has observed. However it must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check if it engages in any behavior it does not know of the creature in front of creatures that know it.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the mimic can't use its slam against another target.
