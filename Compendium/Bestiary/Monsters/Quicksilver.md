### Traits
***Dispersed Motion.*** Attacks against the quicksilver have disadvantage unless the quicksilver is incapacitated. Whenever the quicksilver uses a Dash action, its AC increases to 18 until the start of its next turn. The quicksilver can move through any opening that air can pass through. If it ends its movement in a passage smaller than itself, it takes 14 ({@dice 4d6}) force damage and falls prone at the closest end of the passage where its physical body can fit.

***Evasion.*** If the quicksilver is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Moon Dragon Thrall.*** If the quicksilver fails its saving throw against a moon dragon's Hypnotic Presence ability, it is permanently charmed by the dragon instead of suffering the normal effects. While charmed, the quicksilver views the dragon as its master and obeys its commands without question.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The quicksilver makes three attacks with its quicksilver knife.

***Quicksilver Knife.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d4+6}) piercing damage.
