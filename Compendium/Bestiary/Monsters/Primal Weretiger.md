### Traits
***Shapechanger.*** The weretiger's natural form is that of a humanoid. Any humanoid's statistics can serve as the weretiger's natural form. The weretiger can't voluntarily change shape, it automatically changes to its beast form after sundown on every full moon night and changes back to humanoid form at first sunlight. The transformation takes two rounds, and the weretiger is incapacitated while transforming. Gear is not transformed, and worn items are likely to break. Magic items instead simply fall off. In humanoid form, the weretiger uses its humanoid form's statistics, except it has the weretiger's Keen Hearing and Smell and Shapechanger ability. When changing shape, the weretiger retains the difference between its current hit points and hit point maximum from the previous form if the current hit points are lower. If the weretiger is killed in beast form, it dies in that form and does not revert to humanoid form. Keen Hearing and Smell. The weretiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pounce.*** If the weretiger moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weretiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The weretiger makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with primal weretiger lycanthropy.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) slashing damage.
