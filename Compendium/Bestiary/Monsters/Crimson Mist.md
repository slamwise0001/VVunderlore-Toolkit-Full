### Traits
***Engulf.*** When a crimson mist strikes a target with one of its tentacles, it can immediately make an engulf attack by entering the opponent's space. The engulfed creature can attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to evade the attack. Success indicates the character avoids the attack entirely by retreating or stepping aside as the crimson mist moves forward. Failure indicates the crimson mist's body encloses the target, trapping the target inside. An engulfed character is restrained, takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic and psychic damage at the start of each of its turns, and immediately begins suffocating. An engulfed character can escape by winning a Dexterity contest against the crimson mist. A crimson mist can engulf only one Medium or smaller creature at a time, and doing so prevents it from attacking with one of its tentacles.

***Susceptibility.*** If a creature dies from the crimson mist's engulf attack, the crimson mist's speed drops to 30 ft., its Stealth bonus drops to +3 (it flushes crimson, hence the name), and attacks against it have tactical advantage. These effects last for 1 hour.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A crimson mist attacks twice with tentacles.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and engulfed (see above).
