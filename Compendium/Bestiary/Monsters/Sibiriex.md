### Traits
***Bile (Recharge 5—6).*** As a bonus action, the sibiriex spews black bile from the feeding tubes dangling from the lower end of its body. One creature the sibiriex can see within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 42 ({@dice 12d6}) acid damage and be poisoned for one minute. At the end of each of its turns a creature can attempt a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***Telekinesis.*** The sibiriex has telekinetic abilities that allow it to manipulate its chains and use them as tentacle—like appendages and otherwise function as the telekinesis spell. The sibiriex does not have to concentrate to maintain the effect, the effect has no time limit, and the sibiriex's spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence. The telekinesis can be dispelled or supressed by a dispel magic, antimagic field, or similar effect. If the telekinesis is dispelled, the sibiriex must use an action to reestablish it. While it is dispelled or suppressed, the sibiriex's chains hang lifelessly from its form and it cannot use its chain attack.

***Magic Resistance.*** The sibiriex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sibiriex can use its beguiling form. It then makes two chain attacks.

***Chain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 4d6+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Beguiling Form (Recharge 5—6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the sibiriex that can see it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 ({@dice 4d6}) psychic damage and be charmed for one minute as its mind is warped to see the sibiriex as the perfect expression of phsyical beauty and it is consumed by a sense of diminished self worth. While charmed, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against the sibiriex's spells. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the charmed effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.

***Graft (3/Day).*** The sibiriex attaches an abyssal graft (see Abyssal Grafts sidebar on page 160) to a willing creature other than a construct or undead it can reach with its chains within 10 feet. The creature takes 45 ({@dice 10d8}) slashing damage in the process. Alternatively the sibiriex can take its time applying the graft in a process that take both the sibiriex's and the target's attention for 1 hour but does not cause any damage or expend a use of the sibiriex's graft ability.
