### Traits
***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 14 ( 4d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The hobgoblin makes three melee attacks. Alternatively, it can make two ranged attacks with its javelins.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( 1d8+3) slashing damage, or 8 ( 1d10+3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ( 1d4+3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Javelin.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ( 1d6+3) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.
