**Challenge**: 1/4

### Traits
***Pheromone.*** If the howler wasp is reduced to 0 hit ppoints or fewer by a melee attack, before it dies or falls unconscious, it can as a reaction spray the attacker with a pheromone that incites other howler wasps to violently pursue the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be doused in the pheromone. While the creature is doused, other howler wasps have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. The pheromone fades after 10 minute or can be washed off by submerging the creature in water.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The howler wasp makes two melee attacks, one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d4+1}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d4+1}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) poison.
