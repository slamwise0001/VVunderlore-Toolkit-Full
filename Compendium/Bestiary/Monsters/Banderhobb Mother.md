### Traits
***Resonant Connection.*** If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object within 1 mile of the banderhobb.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 30 ({@dice 7d6+6}) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the banderhobb can't use its bite against another creature.

***Tongue.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and the target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb, which can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.

***Swallow.*** The banderhobb mother makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb, and it takes 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb mother's turns. A creature that dies this way starts transforming into a banderhobb. If the creature was a Medium or Large humanoid, the banderhobb mother regurgitates a fully formed regular banderhobb (see Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 122) {@dice 1d6} rounds after the creature died. If the creature was a Small or Tiny humanoid, the banderhobb mother regurgitates a banderhobb filch {@dice 1d4} rounds after it died. A newly spawned banderhobb filch cannot use its sack action until it acquired a sack or other bag large enough to hold the creature it intends to sack. If the creature was not a humanoid, it transforms into a lifeless, deformed mass of flesh vaguely resembling banderhobb features and is regurgitated dead. The banderhobb mother must use its action to do so and cannot choose not to regurgitate a banderhobb, once it is fully gestated. The banderhobb mother will regurgitate a banderhobb even when it is incapacitated or otherwise prevented from taking an action, unless it is frozen, petrified, or otherwise suspended in a similar state of stasis. When the banderhobb mother regurgitates a creature, that creature exits prone in a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb mother. If the banderhobb mother dies, any swallowed creatures are likewise regurgitated. The banderhobb mother can only have one Medium or Large creature, or up to two Small or smaller creatures swallowed at a time. If multiple swallowed creatures die at the same time, roll for each individually to see how long it takes for them to transform into banderhobbs.

***Shadow Step.*** The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see. Before or after teleporting, it may make a bite or tongue attack.
