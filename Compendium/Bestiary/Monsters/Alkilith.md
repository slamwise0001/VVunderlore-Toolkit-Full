### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***False Appearance.*** While the alkilith is motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary slime or fungus.

***Foment Madness.*** Any creature that isn't a demon that starts its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. If the saving throw against Foment Madness fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the confusion spell for 1 minute (no concentration required by the alkilith). While under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to Foment Madness.

***Magic Resistance.*** The alkilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The alkilith makes three tentacle attacks.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ( 4d6+4) acid damage.
