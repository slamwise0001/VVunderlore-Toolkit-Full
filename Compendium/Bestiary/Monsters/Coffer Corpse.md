### Traits
***Death Grip.*** A creature that is grappled by a coffer corpse can't speak or cast spells that have verbal components.

***Deceiving Death.*** The first time a coffer corpse's hit points are reduced below 20, the creature collapses to the ground as if slain. A grappled creature is released. To all inspection, the coffer corpse appears destroyed. At the start of its next turn, the coffer corpse regains {@dice 3d6} hit points and rises again as if reanimated. Every creature that sees the coffer corpse rise must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 2d4} rounds or until they see the coffer corpse destroyed.

***Magic Weapon.*** A coffer corpse's claws are treated as an attack from a magic weapon.

### Actions
***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) magic, slashing damage and the target is grappled.

***Stragulation.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the coffer corpse at the start of the coffer corpse's turn. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it runs out of breath and begins suffocating. If the strangled creature escapes from the coffer corpse's grapple, suffocation ends immediately but the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
