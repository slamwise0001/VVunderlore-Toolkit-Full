### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The drake makes one bite attack, two claw attacks, and one stinger attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4 rounds. While poisoned this way, the target takes {@dice 1d4} Constitution damage per round. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect with a success. When animate dead is cast on creatures killed by this poison, the caster requires no material components.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5â€”6).*** A deep drake blasts forth a crackling 80-foot line of purple-black energy that wracks its victims with pain. This attack deals 35 ({@dice 10d6}) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Targets that fail this saving throw must also succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for {@dice 1d4} rounds.
