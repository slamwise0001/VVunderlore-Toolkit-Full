### Traits
***Burning Grip.*** The body of a lesser fire crab generates intense heat. Any creature that starts its turn with one or more lesser fire crabs latched onto it takes 2 fire damage for each of those lesser fire crabs. Once a lesser fire crab has latched onto a character, it moves with that character when the character moves, as if the character was moving a grappled character (half-speed). A lesser fire crab releases its grip when killed or when the character wins a Strength contest against it. Up to four lesser fire crabs can latch onto a Small character, and up to eight can latch onto a Medium character.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A lesser fire crab makes two pincer attacks. Both must be against the same target.

***Pincer.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) slashing damage plus 2 ({@dice 1d4}) fire damage and the lesser fire crab latches onto the target with its burning grip (see above).
