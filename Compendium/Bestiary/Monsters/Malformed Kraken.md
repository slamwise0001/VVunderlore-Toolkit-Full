### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The kraken can breathe air and water.

***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d8+7}) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d6+7}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken 's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet of it. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 ({@dice 3d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
