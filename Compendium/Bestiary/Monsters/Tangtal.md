### Traits
***Duplicate (1/Day).*** As an action, a tangtal creates {@dice 2d4} images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must stay within 10 feet of at least one other image. Images have the same AC and speed as the tangtal and 1 hit point apiece; an image disappears when it takes any damage. An image can be damaged only by an attack that targets and damages it specifically; images arent affected by area attacks or nondamaging effects. An attack that targets the tangtal has a chance to hit an image instead, in exact proportion to the number of images; e.g., if there are six images, an attack against the tangtal has a 1-in-7 chance to hit it and a 6-in-7 chance to hit an image.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A tangtal bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage.
