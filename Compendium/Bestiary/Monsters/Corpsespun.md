### Traits
***Spider-Infested.*** Spiders continually crawl out of corpsespun, swarm over them, and fall to the ground around the undead's feet. All creatures other than a corpsepinner or other corpsespun that are adjacent to a corpsespun at the end of the corpsespun's turn take 2 ({@dice 1d4}) poison damage from spider bites. This damage is cumulative from multiple adjacent corpsespun.

### Actions
***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) slashing damage plus 2 ({@dice 1d4}) poison damage and the target is poisoned. A poisoned creature can make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the condition.

***Spider Spray (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Attack: automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, all creatures in cone. Hit: target must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage.
