### Traits
***Yip.*** Doombats yip constantly while in combat, and the noise interferes with spellcasters' concentration. Creatures within 100 ft. of any number of yipping doombats must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw every time they attempt to cast a spell. Success indicates the spell is cast. Failure with a result of 9 or higher indicates the spell is not cast, but the spell slot is not expended. Failure with a result of 8 or lower indicates the spell is not cast and the spell slot is expended.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The doombat bites once and attacks once with its tail.

***Birte.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+5}) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Shriek (Recharge 5â€”6).*** A doombat can emit a piercing shriek as an action. All creatures that can hear the doombat's shriek (except other doombats) within a 100 ft. radius must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure indicates that the creature has tactical disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early with a successful save. A successful saving throw also gives the creature immunity to the shrieks of that doombat for 24 hours.
