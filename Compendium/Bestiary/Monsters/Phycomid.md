### Traits
***Spore Infection.*** A creature that fails the DC 11 Constitution saving throw against a phycomid's fluid glob attack is infected with the plant's spores. Tiny mushroomlike growths sprout from the creature's body. These look like fine, white hairs at first, but after 10 minutes they become recognizable as distinct mushroom shapes. An infected creature takes 1 acid damage and its maximum number of hit points declines by 1 at the start of each of its turns, until the infestation is ended with a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic, or by spending {@dice 2d4} rounds burning away the phycomid spores or scraping them off with a dagger or other edged weapon. Scraping or burning causes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) slashing or fire damage per round. A creature can't take any other actions during a round when it is destroying a spore infection. If a creature dies while infected, its body immediately sprouts a new, full-strength phycomid.

### Actions
***Fluid Glob.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, range 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be infected by phycomid spores (see above).
