### Traits
***Hold Breath.*** The bukavac can hold its breath for up to 20 minutes.

***Hop.*** A bukavac can move its enormous bulk with remarkably quick hop of up to 20 feet, leaping over obstacles and foes. It may also use the hop as part of a withdraw action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bukavac makes four claw attacks, or two claw attacks and one bite attack, or two claw attacks and one gore attack, or one bite and one gore attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d12+5}) slashing damage and grapples (escape DC 15). A bukavac can grapple up to 2 Medium size foes.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Croaking Blast (Recharge 5â€”6).*** A bukavac can emit a howling thunderclap that deafens and damages those nearby. Creatures within 15 feet who fail a DC 17 Constitution saving throw take 36 ({@dice 8d8}) thunder damage and are permanently deafened. Those succeeding on the saving throw take half damage and are not deafened. The deafness can be cured with lesser restoration.
