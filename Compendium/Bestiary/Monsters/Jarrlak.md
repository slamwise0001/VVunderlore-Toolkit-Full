### Traits
***Frigid Tomb.*** A creature that fails its Constitution saving throw against a jarrlak's bite or freezing blast ability is slowed by the cold for one minute. The creature takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws. It can only make a single attack when using the attack action, and when it attempts to cast a spell it must roll a d20. On an 11 or highter, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. If a creature that is already slowed by frigid tomb fails its Constitution saving throw against a jarrlak's bite or freezing blast ability, it becomes paralyzed for one minute. If a creature that is already paralyzed by frigid tomb fails its saving throw against a jarrlak's bite or freezing blast ability, it becomes permanently encased in ice. It is paralyzed and the next time it takes damage, the ice casing shatters and the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. A creature that has been encased for an hour or longer dies if the ice is shattered. A creature that is affected by frigid tomb, but not encased in ice by it, can attempt a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The frigid tomb abilities of different jarrlaks stack with each other. A creature that has been encased in ice can be freed by thawing it for 10 minutes with a torch or produce flame cantrip or similar flame.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) cold damage. If the target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be affected by the jarrlak's frigid tomb ability.

***Freezing Burst (Recharge 4â€”6).*** The jarrlak releases a wave of unnatural cold. Creatures within 15 feet of the jarrlak must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, being affected by the jarrlak's frigid tomb ability and taking 24 ({@dice 7d6}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
