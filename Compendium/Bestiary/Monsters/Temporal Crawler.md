### Traits
***Foresight.*** A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a temporal crawler from ever being surprised and grants it an AC bonus equal to its Wisdom modifier (already factored into its AC). In addition, attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

***Immunity to Temporal Magic.*** Temporal crawlers are unaffected by magic that alters or manipulates time in any way.

***Slowing Webs.*** Creatures other than temporal crawlers that are within 10 feet of the webbing in a temporal crawlers lair must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or uffer the effects of a slow spell. The slowing effect ends {@dice 1d4} rounds after the creature leaves the affected area.

***Webbing Trap (1/Day).*** The approach to a temporal crawler lair usually is trapped by a concealed net of webbing. The trap, which covers a 20-foot-by-20-foot area, can be spotted with a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Each creature entering the trapped area has a 1-in-3 chance to set it off. When the trap is triggered, the webbing drops and each creature in the trapped area must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. Alternatively, the webs restraining one creature can be destroyed by 10 points of slashing or fire damage (AC 10).

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) poison damage and be paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the poison damage.

***Webs (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Attack: automatic hit, range 50 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. Alternatively, the restraining webs can be destroyed by 10 points of slashing or fire damage (AC 10).
