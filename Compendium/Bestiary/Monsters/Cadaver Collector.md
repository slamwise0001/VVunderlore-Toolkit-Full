### Traits
***Immutable Form.*** The cadaver collector is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The cadaver collector has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The cadaver collector's weapon attacks are magical.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cadaver collector makes two fist attacks.

***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( 2d6+6) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The cadaver collecter has two fists, each of which can grapple one Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the fist can't be used to make attacks.

***Impale.*** The cadaver collector attempts to impale a Medium or Small creature it is grappling on its backspikes. It makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the cadaver collector is successful, the grapple ends and the creature takes 27 ( 6d6+6) piercing damage and is restrained on the cadaver collector's back, sharing space with the cadaver collector. On the cadaver collector's following turns, the creature takes an additional 10 ( 3d6) piercing damage once per round if the collector moves or takes an action. A creature can use an action to attempt to pull itself or another creature in arm's reach free from the spikes by making a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the impaled creature is no longer restrained and drops off the cadaver collector's back, immediately being moved to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the collector. The cadaver collector can have up to six Medium or Small creatures impaled on its backspikes.

***Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The cadaver collector releases a paralyzing gas in a 20-foot cone. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
