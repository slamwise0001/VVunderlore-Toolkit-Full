### Traits
***Incorporeal.*** A clamor can pass through solid objects such as a wall, or other creatures, as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it is still inside another object at the end of its turn. It can move in total silence when it chooses to.

***Natural Invisibility.*** As creatures of living sound, a clamor is naturally invisible, even when it attacks. This ability can't be "switched off" or negated by any means. See invisibility adds a ghostly outline around a clamor, but true seeing reveals nothing, because the clamor has no visible form to reveal.

***Sound Mimicry.*** A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect accuracy. It can duplicate speech, music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when duplicated.

***Speed of Sound (1/Day).*** Once per day, a clamor can fly at the speed of sound for four minutes, an effective speed of 6,730 feet per round. It can't attack or use any other abilities when moving this way. In four minutes, it can cover 51 miles (82 kilometers).

***Sound-Related Vulnerabilities.*** Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 13 ({@dice 3d8}) force damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Constitution saving throw against the spellcaster's DC or become frightened for one minute. In addition, any spells or abilities that deal thunder damage require the clamor to make a successful Constitution saving throw or be affected as if hit by a confusion spell for one minute. Spells or abilities that manipulate sound in pleasing or at least nonlethal ways (such as a bard's countercharm ability) require the clamor to make a successful Charisma saving throw or be affected as if charmed for one hour. The DC of both saving throws equals 8 + the attacker's applicable ability score modifier+the attacker's proficiency bonus. The DM has final say whether a specific spell or ability affects a clamor, and how.

### Actions
***Thunder.*** Melee Attack Touch: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d8+7}) thunder damage and the target is pushed 5 feet away from the clamor.

***Sonic Ray.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d6+7}) thunder damage and the target is deafened until the start of the clamor's next turn.

***Sonic Burst (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 100 ft. sphere centered on clamor, all creatures in range. Hit: every target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for {@dice 1d3} rounds. Living creatures within 50 feet of the clamor are also permanently deafened if this saving throw fails. Greater restoration, wish, or comparable magic can restore a creature's hearing.
