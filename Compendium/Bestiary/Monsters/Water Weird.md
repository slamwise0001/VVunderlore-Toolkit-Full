***Invisible in Water.*** The water weird is invisible while fully immersed in water.

***Water Bound.*** The water weird dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.


### Actions
***Constrict.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ( 3d6+3) bludgeoning damage.
