### Traits
***Create Spawn.*** Any humanoid slain by a darnoc reanimates as a darnoc in {@dice 1d4} rounds. Spawned darnoc are under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved until its death, when they become independent. They do not retain any of the abilities they had in life.

***Ghost Form.*** As an action, a darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes each day. While incorporeal, the darnoc has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, it gains tactical advantage on attack rolls, its slam attack does an extra {@dice 1d6} necrotic damage, and it can move through creatures and solid objects as though they were difficult terrain. The darnoc takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it is still inside another solid object or creature at the end of its turn.

***Symbol of Discord (1/Day).*** Once per day as an action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol of discord in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him or her. Meaningful communication is impossible while bickering. If creatures of different alignments are affected and bickering, each has a 30% chance that they feel compelled to attack the person they are bickering with who is the most different in alignment. Bickering lasts {@dice 5d4} rounds. Fighting (if it occurs) begins {@dice 1d4} rounds into the bickering and lasts {@dice 2d4} rounds. Once drawn, the darnoc's symbol lasts two hours, making it useful as a temporary trap or delaying tactic.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) bludgeoning damage, and the creature's maximum number of hit points is reduced by the same amount. Hit points lost to this attack can't be healed by any means until the darnoc's curse is broken with a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.
