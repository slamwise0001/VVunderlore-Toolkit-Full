### Traits
***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

***Corrupted Carrier.*** When the orc is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, and any creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 ( 4d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. While poisoned by this effect, a creature can't regain hit points.

***Nurtured One of Yurtrus.*** The orc has advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.


### Actions
***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) slashing damage plus 2 ( 1d4) necrotic damage.

***Corrupted Vengeance.*** The orc reduces itself to 0 hit points, triggering its Corrupted Carrier trait.
