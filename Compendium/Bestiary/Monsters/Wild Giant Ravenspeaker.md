### Traits
***Call Murder.*** The ravenspeaker can use its action to summon a swarm of ravens. This swarm uses the normal statistics for a swarm of ravens except that it is a Large swarm, has a challenge rating of 3, 72 hit points ({@dice 16d10}â€”16) and its beaks deal 21 ({@dice 6d6}) piercing damage, or 10 ({@dice 3d6}) if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The swarm appears anywhere within 60 feet of the ravenspeaker. It acts on the ravenspeaker's initiative and obeys the ravenspeaker's commands. The swarm lasts until the ravenspeaker dismisses it at any point during one of its

***turns (no action required).*** If the swarm has taken damage before it was dismissed it returns the next time the ravenspeaker summons it with that many hit points plus {@dice 1d8} hit points for every full hour it has been dismissed. If the swarm of ravens is destroyed, the ravenspeaker cannot summon it again for 24 hours, after which the swarm can be summoned again at full health. If the ravenspeaker is knocked unconscious or dies, the swarm automatically scatters and disappears. Raven's flight. As a bonus action the ravenspeaker can sprout a pair of large ghostly raven wings, gaining a 50-foot fly speed, while in darkness or dim light. It can dismiss the wings at any time (no action required).
