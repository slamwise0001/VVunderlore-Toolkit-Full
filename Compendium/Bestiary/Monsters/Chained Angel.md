### Traits
***Dark Halo.*** A chained angel is immune to direct damage spells from divine casters.

***Redemption.*** Any caster brave enough to cast a knock spell on a chained angel can remove the creature's shackles—but this always exposes the caster to an immediate fiery greatsword attack as a reaction. If the caster survives that attack, the angel makes an immediate DC 20 Wisdom saving throw; if it succeeds, the angel's chains fall away and it is restored to its senses and to a Good alignment. If the saving throw fails, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel's chains fail automatically for one week.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The chained angel makes two fiery greatsword attacks.

***Fiery Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@dice 3d10}) fire damage.

***Fallen Glory (Recharge 5—6).*** Ranged Spell Attack: All creatures within 50 feet of the chained angel and in its line of sight take 19 ({@dice 3d12}) radiant damage and are knocked prone, or take half damage and aren't knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.
