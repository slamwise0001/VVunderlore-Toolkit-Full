### Traits
***Tunneler.*** The cave dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot wide, 5-foot high tunnel in its wake.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) poison damage.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The dragon exhales a cone of black poison gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) poison damage on a failed save and the target is poisoned if it is a creature. The poisoned condition lasts until the target takes a long or short rest or removes the condition with lesser restoration. If the save is successful, the target takes half the damage and does not become poisoned.
