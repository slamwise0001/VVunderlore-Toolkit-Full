### Traits
***Creature Sense.*** The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

***Magic Resistance.*** The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


### Actions
***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ( 3d8+8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ( 3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelid, and it takes 35 ( 10d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelid's turns. If the neothelid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the neothelid must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the neothelid. If the neothelid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Acid Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The neothelid exhales acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 ( 10d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
