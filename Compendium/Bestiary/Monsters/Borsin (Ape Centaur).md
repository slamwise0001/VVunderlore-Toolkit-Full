### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A borsin attacks twice with claws and bites once.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d6+5}) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the second attack inflicts an additional 7 ({@dice 2d6}) slashing damage and the borsin gains tactical advantage on its bite attack, if that attack is made immediately against the same target.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d8+5}) piercing damage.
