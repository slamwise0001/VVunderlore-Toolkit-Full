### Traits
***Spider Climb.*** The haures can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** The haures ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Adhesive Skin.*** A creature that touches the haures or hits it with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or get stuck in the Haures's flesh. While it is stuck, a creature can't attack with the same weapon, and attacks against the creature have advantage. A creature can let go of the weapon it hit the haures with as a free action to end the effect on itself, or at the end of its turn repeat the saving throw ending, the effect on itself on a success.

***Magic Weapons.*** The haures's weapon attacks are magical.

***Magic Resistance.*** The haures has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The haures makes four melee attacks, two with its war picks and two with its claws. War pick. Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 3d8+6}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+6}) slashing damage.

***Web Grab.*** All creatures in a 30 ft. cone must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained and be pulled 30 feet directly toward the haures. A creature can use its action to attempt a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check, ending the condition on itself or another creature within 5 feet on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 20; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage), freeing one creature from it.
