### Traits
***Drone.*** The rapid beating of the helix moth's wings creates an incessant droning sound that clouds the minds of creatures capable of hearing it. All such creatures within 30 feet of the moth must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a penalty identical to being poisoned (this is not a poison effect, however, so poison resistance and immunity don't apply). The effect lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds); at the end of that time, if the droning can still be heard, the saving throw can be repeated. A successful save renders a creature immune to the droning of helix moths for 12 hours.

***Helix Moth Poison.*** If a player character drops to 0 hit points from a helix moth sting that caused poison damage (the character failed the saving throw), the character stabilizes automatically but remains unconscious for {@dice 2d6} hours. The character must attempt the saving throw even if the sting's piercing damage alone was enough to drop the character to 0 hit points. Healing the character above 0 hit points won't awaken the character before the {@dice 2d6} hours have elapsed. The character can awaken early only if the poison is neutralized by lesser restoration or similar magic.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** An adult helix moth bites once and stings once.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage and the target is grappled. If the helix moth has a target grappled at the start of the moth's turn, it can do 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage to that target automatically if it does not try to bite another target.

***Sting.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage (see Helix Moth Poison above).
