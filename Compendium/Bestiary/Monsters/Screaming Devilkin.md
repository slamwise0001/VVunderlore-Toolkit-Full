### Traits
***Scream.*** A screaming devilkin continuously emits a painful howl. Creatures with hearing must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw every time they start their turn within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin or be incapacitated and deafened until the start of their next turn. It doesnt matter how many screaming devilkin are within range; only one saving throw needs to be made each round. A silence spell can negate devilkin screaming for the duration of the spell.

### Actions
***Tail Barb.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage.
