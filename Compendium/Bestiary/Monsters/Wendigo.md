### Traits
***Beyond Sight.*** The Wendigo is invisible to creatures more than 25 feet away from it.

***Fearsome Gaze.*** If a humanoid creature starts its turn within 40 feet of the wendigo and the two of them can see each other, the wendigo can force the creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw if the wendigo isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for one minute. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throws at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the wendigo until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. At the end of each of its turns a creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Scent of Fear.*** Enemies within 30 feet of the wendigo have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The wendigo makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) piercing damage and the wendigo regains a number of hitpoints equal to the damage dealt. Hunger from Fear. The wendigo instills an unnatural hunger in a creature that is frightened of it. A single creature within 60 feet of the wendigo that is frightened of the wendigo must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the wendigo for 1 hour. While charmed, a creature tries its best to attack other creatures and eat them alive. If the creature has a bite attack, it only uses that, if it doesn't, it bites using an unarmed strike instead. The creature prefers creatures of the same type as itself as

***targets.*** Each turn the creature does not deal damage to another creature, it takes 18 ({@dice 4d8}) psychic damage. At the end of each of its turns a creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
