### Traits
***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The armor is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The armor makes two melee attacks or uses Shocking Bolt twice.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( 2d6+3) slashing damage plus 3 ( 1d6) lightning damage.

***Shocking Bolt.*** Ranged Spell Attack:  +4 to hit (with advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal), range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( 3d6) lightning damage.
