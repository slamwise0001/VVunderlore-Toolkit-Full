### Traits
***Charge.*** If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 ({@dice 2d8}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Shapechanger.*** The wereboar's natural form is that of a humanoid. Any humanoid's statistics can serve as the wereboar's natural form. The wereboar can't voluntarily change shape, it automatically changes to its beast form after sundown on every full moon night and changes back to humanoid form at first sunlight. The transformation takes two rounds, and the werebear is incapacitated while transforming. Gear is not transformed, and worn items are likely to break. Magic items instead simply fall off. In humanoid form, the wereboar uses its humanoid form's statistics, except it has the wereboar's Keen Smell and Shapechanger ability. When changing shape, the wereboar retains the difference between its current hit points and hit point maximum from the previous form if the current hit points are lower. If the wereboar is killed in beast form, it dies in that form and does not revert to humanoid form.

***Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the wereboar takes 20 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The wereboar makes three melee attacks: one with its tusk and two with its slam.

***Tusk.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with primal wereboar lycanthropy.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) bludgeoning damage.
