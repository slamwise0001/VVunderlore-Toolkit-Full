***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage.

***Venomous Spit.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 10/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming paralyzed for as long as it remains blinded on a failure or ending the blinded condition on a success. A blinded and paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending both conditions on a success. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this effect.
