### Traits
***All-Around Awareness.*** A magmoid "sees" perfectly in all directions. Attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

***Magma Body.*** Every time a magmoid is struck by a melee weapon, the weapon's wielder must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or the weapon is destroyed by the heat of the magmoid's body. Magical weapons and bludgeoning weapons have tactical advantage on the saving throw, piercing weapons have tactical disadvantage, and magical piercing weapons have neither advantage nor disadvantage. Missiles are destroyed automatically. Creatures that attack a magmoid unarmed or with natural weapons take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage each time one of their attacks hits.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d8+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage, and the creature takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage at the start of its next turn.

***Magma Blast (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Area Attackast: automatic hit, range 40 ft. line, creatures in line. Hit: Each target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) fire damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage at the start of its turn for {@dice 1d3} turns.
