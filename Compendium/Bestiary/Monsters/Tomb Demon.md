### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The tomb demon makes three melee attacks: one with its battleaxe, one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d12+3}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. While poisoned, the creature is paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the tomb demon can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the tomb demon can't make tail attacks against other targets.
