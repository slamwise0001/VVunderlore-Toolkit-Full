### Traits
***Rage.*** When a ryven is reduced to 12 or fewer hit points in combat, it flies into a berserk rage lasting ten rounds (one minute). While berserk, the ryven has tactical advantage on bite attacks, it uses both its bite and claw attacks, all of its attacks do 2 extra points of damage, and it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It drops whatever it held in its hands and fights solely with tooth and claw. Ryven shamans are immune to rage.

***White and Black Death.*** Some ryven (approximately 1 in 5) coat their weapons and claws with a poison known as the white and black death. A living creature struck by a poisoned weapon or claw must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) poison damage immediately and be poisoned for {@dice 1d6} rounds.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A ryven normally makes one melee attack or one ranged attack. When berserk, it bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) slashing damage; also see White and Black Death, above.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) piercing damage; also see White and Black Death, above.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 80 ft./320 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage; also see White and Black Death, above.
