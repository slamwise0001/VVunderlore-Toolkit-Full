### Traits
***Flawless Tracking.*** An aerial servant can track any creature on the same plane of existence as itself across any terrain automatically.

***Link with Caster.*** When summoned, an aerial servant creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. Should the aerial servant fail the mission it was assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial servant can find the caster as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. If the two are again on the same plane of existence, the link is immediately re-established and the aerial servant moves at full speed toward the caster's location. The link is broken permanently only when the aerial servant or the caster is destroyed.

***Natural Invisibility.*** An aerial servant is permanently invisible, and it remains invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and can't be magically cancelled or dispelled. Invisibility is not factored into the aerial servant's +8 Stealth modifier; it gains the benefits of invisibility in addition. An aerial servant is visible on the Astral and Ethereal Planes, but it is always lightly obscured in those locales.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The aerial servant slams once and constricts once, or uses its wind blast.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+5}) bludgeoning damage, and the target creature is grappled.

***Constrict.*** Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit (one creature grappled by the aerial servant). Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Wind Blast (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Automatic hit (80 ft. line; creatures in the line). Hit: 24 ({@dice 4d10}) bludgeoning damage, and creatures of Medium size or smaller are knocked prone and pushed {@dice 2d10} feet away from the aerial servant. Affected creatures that make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw take half damage and are not knocked prone, but they are pushed away.
