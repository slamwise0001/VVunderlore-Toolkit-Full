### Traits
***Death Throes.*** When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of flame. All creatures within 20 feet of the slain stalker must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful save. The stalker's combustible gear is burned to ash, but other items (shortswords, poison vials, coins, gems) survive the burst of fire.

***Poison.*** Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison. They favor a foul-smelling, dark paste called black smear that they distill from fungi that grows only in deep caverns. Creatures poisoned by black smear take 2 ({@dice 1d4}) poison damage immediately and suffer the usual effect of the poisoned condition. In addition, they must repeat the DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a successful save, they are no longer poisoned; on a failed save, they take {@dice 1d4} poison damage and the poisoned condition continues. Each dark stalker carries six doses of this poison, and they train from childhood to reapply it to their shortswords as a bonus action after a successful hit.

***See in Darkness.*** Light conditions are reversed in effect for dark stalkers. They treat complete darkness as bright light and bright light as complete darkness. A dark stalker sees perfectly in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness.

***Sneak Attack.*** A dark stalker's shortsword attack does an extra 7 ({@dice 2d6}) piercing damage if the dark stalker has advantage on the attack or if another dark stalker or dark creeper is within 5 feet of the target.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A dark stalker attacks twice with shortswords.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned (see below).
