### Traits
***Pounce.*** If the bonedrinker moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the bonedrinker can make two tentacle attacks against it as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bonedrinker makes two melee attacks with any combination of claws and tentacles.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (Escape DC 12). The bonedrinker has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one creature

***Bonedrink.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d4+4}) piercing damage and 14 ({@dice 4d6}) necrotic damage. This attack can only be used against a creature the bonedrinker is grappling. Until the grapple ends or the bonedrinker uses its bonedrink ability on another creature, the target automatically takes 14 ({@dice 4d6}) necrotic damage at the beginning of each of the bonedrinker's turns. Each time the bonedrinker deals necrotic damage with its bonedrink ability it gains half as many temporary hit points.
