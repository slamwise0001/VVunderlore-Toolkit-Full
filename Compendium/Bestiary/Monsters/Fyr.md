### Traits
***Resilient.*** A fyr has tactical advantage on all saving throws.

***Weapon Attunement.*** Fyrs have an ability to attune themselves with any wood-handled weapon, so that they get a +1 attack bonus with such a weapon once they've handled for at least 10 minutes. This bonus is already included in the battleaxe attack line above.

### Actions
***Battleaxe.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) slashing damage.

***Headbutt.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the fyr can make an immediate battleaxe attack against it as a bonus action.
