### Traits
***Strangling.*** When a hawktoad hits a target with its tongue, the monster wraps its tongue around the victim's neck. It then quickly maneuvers itself behind the target, landing on the target's back. The hawktoad digs in its claws and tries to strangle the victim with its tongue. If the targeted creature makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, it gets an arm, a hand, or some other limb or object under the hawktoad's tongue and avoids any further danger from this specific tongue attack; the hawktoad can try again on coming turns. If the Dexterity saving throw fails, the creature is being strangled by the hawktoad; it runs out of breath and begins suffocating. As long as the hawktoad continues strangling it, the unconscious creature can't stabilize by making successful death saving throws. If the hawktoad is killed or its stranglehold is broken, the victim can recover normally. A creature has tactical disadvantage on attacks against a hawktoad that has grappled it and is clinging to its back. A hawktoad uses its Dex in contests to maintain its grapple, instead of Str.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A hawktoad attacks once with claws and once with its tongue.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) slashing damage.

***Tongue.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is grappled and strangled (see above).
