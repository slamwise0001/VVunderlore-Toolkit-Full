### Traits
***Dual Shields.*** The giant carries two shields, each of which is accounted for in the giant's AC. The giant must stow or drop one of its shields to hurl rocks.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two fireshield attacks.

***Fireshield.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 ({@dice 4d6+8}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) piercing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 30 ({@dice 4d10+8}) bludgeoning damage.

***Shield Charge.*** The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target must also succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of this move. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone and takes 18 ({@dice 3d6+8}) bludgeoning damage, or 29 ({@dice 6d6+8}) bludgeoning damage if it was already prone.
