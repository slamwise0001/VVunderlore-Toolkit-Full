### Traits
***Olive Slime Defenses.*** The armor class and hit points listed above are for a Large patch of olive slime in its native environment. Olive slime on a victim has the victim's AC and hit points equal to the number of Constitution points the victim has lost.

***Olive Slime Infestation.*** Any amount of olive slime that remains in contact with a potential victim for more than two minutes charms the victim and alters his or her thinking patterns so that the host's main concern becomes feeding and protecting the olive slime"including keeping the slime hidden from companions. If anyone tries to remove the olive slime from the host, the host does whatever is required to protect the slime, whether it's running away or fighting back. As long as the host is alive and conscious, it will do everything in its power to protect the slime, including knocking out or even killing its friends. An infested creature suffers the following effects." It loses 1 point of Constitution immediately when the infestation begins and another {@dice 1d6} points of Constitution at the end of each 24-hour period, as the growing olive slime replaces the creature's skin, muscle, and organs with olive slime. The olive slime gains hit points equal to the number of Constitution points lost by the victim." The host must double its normal food intake or lose 1 extra point of Constitution after each 24 hours. Also, the host does not recover hit points or hit dice after a long rest if it didn't double its food intake." If the host's Constitution drops to 0, the host dies. Five minutes later, its body reanimates as an olive slime zombie.Olive slime can be burned, cut away, or frozen. Anything that damages the olive slime deals half damage to its host (before doubling for vulnerability in the case of acid, cold, or fire damage). Greater restoration ends the olive slime's charm effect for two minutes; during that time, the victim can cooperate with attempts to remove the slime.

### Actions
***Drop.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature beneath the olive slime. Hit: target creature must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to notice the olive slime that dripped onto it. If the olive slime is noticed and removed immediately, it has no effect. If the olive slime is not noticed and removed within two minutes, the creature loses 1 point of Constitution and is infested with olive slime; see above.
