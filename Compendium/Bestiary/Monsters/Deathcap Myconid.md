### Traits
***Distress Spores.*** When a deathcap myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The myconid uses either its Deathcap Spores or its Slumber Spores, then makes a fist attack.

***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 4d4+1}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@dice 4d4}) poison damage.

***Deathcap Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 3 rounds. While poisoned this way, the target also takes 10 ({@dice 4d4}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Slumber Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall prone and unconscious for 1 minute.
