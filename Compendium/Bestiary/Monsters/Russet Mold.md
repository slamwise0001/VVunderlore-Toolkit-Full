### Traits
***Camouflage.*** From a distance of 10 feet or more, russet mold is indistinguishable from the normal rust stains that are often seen in damp dungeons and caves. On closer inspection (within 10 feet), it can be identified with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. Once characters are familiar with it (theyve had a prior encounter with russet mold), it can be identified automatically, but this identification still requires close inspection.

### Actions
***Spores.*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 5 ft. radius, all creatures in radius. Hit: each target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take {@dice 2d6} poison damage and become poisoned. While poisoned, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the poisoned condition ends; on a failed save, the creature takes another 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage. A creature that dies from this poison damage reanimates 24 hours later, transformed into a vegepygmy commoner. The spores remain active in a dead creatures body, so if a creature is restored to life before it reanimates, it is still poisoned and it continues taking poison damage until the poison is neutralized magically or by a successful save.
