### Traits
***Planar Travel.*** The dragon can cast plane shift without material components after spending one hour in uninterrupted meditation.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+6}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d6+6}) slashing damage.

***Explosive Gem (Recharge 5—6).*** The dragon spits an amethyst sphere up to 30 feet away. The gem explodes into razor—sharp shards in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 ({@dice 14d6}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
