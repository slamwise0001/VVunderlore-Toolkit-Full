### Traits
***Spider Climb.*** The spider shark can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider shark knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider shark ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The spider shark can make a hooked claw attack, a burrowing tooth attack, and a barbed web attack.

***Burrowing Tooth.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d8+3}) damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or take an additional 4 ({@dice 1d8}) damage at the beginning of its turn each round. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Hooked Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, range 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d8+3}) damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw, or be grappled and pulled towards the spider shark. While the target is grappled, attacks against it have advantage.

***Barbed Web Attack.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, range 90/90 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d10+2}) damage, and the target is retrained. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 18 Strength check, destroying from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 15; 25 hit points; is vulnerable to fire damage; and is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

***Web Net (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The spider shark launches webs at a 30-foot radius area within 90 feet. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature takes 18 ({@dice 3d10+2}) damage and is restrained by webbing.  As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 18 Strength check, destroying from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 15; 25 hit points; is vulnerable to fire damage; and is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
