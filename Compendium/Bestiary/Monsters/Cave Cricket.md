### Traits
***Chirp.*** Creatures within 20 feet of a chirping cave cricket can't be heard unless they scream. Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 9 Constitution saving throw to cast a spell correctly. Failure indicates the spell is not cast, but the slot is not expended. The chirping doubles the chance of attracting wandering monsters, if applicable.

### Actions
***Kick.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) bludgeoning damage.
