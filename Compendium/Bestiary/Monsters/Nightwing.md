### Traits
***Blend with Shadows.*** The nightshade has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.

***Desecrating Aura.*** Other undead creatures have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on attack rolls and saving throws while within 20 feet of the nightshade.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nightshade has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sunlight Aversion.*** While in natural sunlight (a daylight spell does not suffice), the nightshade has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 4d6+6}) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or a magic item it is carrying that the nightwing is aware of loses its magic properties and becomes a mundane object. The magic item can be restored with a dispel evil and good spell.

***Summon Undead (1/Night).*** The nightshade calls upon undead creatures lurking in the darkness nearby. Within {@dice 1d6} rounds, {@dice 1d6+6 }Shadows (see Monster Manual p. 269) each arrive in an unoccupied space anywhere within 60 feet of the nightshade, serving the nightshade as allies.
