### Traits
***Blood Whip.*** A skelzis vicious blood whip causes wounds that bleed profusely. A creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every time it takes damage from a blood whip. If the saving throw fails, the wound is bleeding freely and the creature takes 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) damage at the start of each of its turns. Bleeding continues for {@dice 1d6} rounds unless it is ended early with magical healing. Bleeding is also stopped if the affected creature or another creature adjacent to it binds the wound by spending an action and making a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Every bleeding wound causes additional damage and must be treated separately; a character that was struck three times by blood whips, for example, takes 7 ({@dice 3d4+6}) damage at the start of its next turn if none of those wounds are treated before then. A blood whip behaves as a normal whip when wielded by anyone who is not a skelzi.

***Chameleonic Hide.*** If they shed their garments, skelzis can hide when they are lightly obscured, their Stealth bonus increases to +6, and they have tactical advantage on Stealth checks and on initiative rolls.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A skelzi attacks once with claws and once with its blood whip.

***Blood Whip.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) slashing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take continuing damage from bleeding (see Blood Whip, above).

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) slashing damage.
