### Traits
***Combat Mobility.*** Opportunity attacks against a moving murder crow always have tactical disadvantage.

***Death Throes.*** If a murder crow is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into a swarm of ravens that continues to relentlessly attack all living creatures within sight. These ravens are undead, and they have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

***Eye Rake.*** If a murder crow hits the same target with its claws and beak in the same round, the target must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for {@dice 1d4} rounds. If a creature is blinded more than once during an encounter, the condition lasts until the creature is healed of all damage or the blindness is removed magically.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A murder crow attacks once with claws and once with its beak. If both attacks hit the same target, see Eye Rake above.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage.

***Beak.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.
