### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.

***Shortspear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) piercing damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 6).*** The behtu exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 21 ({@dice 5d8}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.

***Ichorous Infusions.*** Behtu war parties carry {@dice 1d6} vials of ichorous infusions. They often ingest an infusion before an ambush. For the next {@dice 2d6} rounds, the behtus gain a +4 bonus to their Strength and Constitution scores and quadruple their base speed (including their climb speed). Behtus also take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores for the duration of the infusion. A non-behtu character who ingests a behtu infusion becomes poisoned and takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage; a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison reduces damage to half and negates the poisoned condition.
