### Traits
***Create Spawn.*** Any living creature slain by a fear guard has tactical disadvantage on its death saving throws. If it dies, it will rise again as a fear guard under the control of its killer {@dice 1d6} rounds later.

***Daylight Vulnerability.*** A fear guard suffers 7 ({@dice 2d6}) points of radiant damage if it is exposed to true sunlight (not magical sunlight or artificial, bright light) at the start of its turn, and it is slowed (as the spell) until the start of its next turn.

***Incorporeal.*** A fear guard can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ({@dice 1d1})0 force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

***Shadow Stealth.*** If the fear guard ends its turn in dim light or darkness, it can use a bonus action to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to become hidden, with tactical advantage on the check. Because it is incorporeal and all of its movement is flight, it makes very little sound when moving and never leaves footprints or disturbs dust on the floor.

### Actions
***Greatsword.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) necrotic damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage.
