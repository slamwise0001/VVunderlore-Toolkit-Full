### Traits
***Astral Scent.*** An astral shark is highly attuned to the energy of a traveler in the Astral Plane. It automatically detects all living creatures within 180 ft. of itself.

***Sever Silver Cord.*** When an astral shark scores a critical hit with its bite, in addition to the normal effects of a critical hit, the target creature must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Failure indicates that the astral shark severed the silver cord connecting the target's astral form to its material body, and the target creature dies instantly.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d12+3}) piercing damage.
