### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The fihyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sunlight Vulnerability.*** A fihyr, that is exposed to natural sunlight (not just a daylight spell or similar magic) instantly dies, dissolving in a hissing, bubbling puddle of flesh.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The fihyr can use its frightful gibbering. It then makes two melee attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bites.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) piercing damage

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Gibbering.*** Each creature of the fihyr's choice that is in a 20 foot radius around the fihyr and can hear it must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the fihyr's frightful gibbering for the next 24 hours.
