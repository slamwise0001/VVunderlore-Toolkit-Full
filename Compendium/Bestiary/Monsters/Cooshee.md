### Traits
***Dominate.*** A cooshee that has its opponent restrained and prone makes it very difficult for that foe to stand up again. To stand up, the creature must break the grapple, which also ends the restraint. If the creature fails in its attempt to break free, it takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) piercing damage.

***Sprint.*** Once per hour, a cooshee can move ten times its normal speed (400 ft.) for one round. When sprinting, it gains tactical advantage on Stealth checks.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A cooshee bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) piercing damage and the target is knocked prone and grappled and restrained (see Dominate above).

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 3d6+3}) slashing damage.
