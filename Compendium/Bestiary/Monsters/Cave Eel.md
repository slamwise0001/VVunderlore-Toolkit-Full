### Traits
***Concealed Burrow.*** Cave eels conceal their burrows skillfully, so they have tactical advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to be hidden at the beginning of an encounter. An attacking cave eel lunges from its cave, bites a victim within 5 feet, and then withdraws back into its burrow without triggering an opportunity attack. While in a burrow, a cave eel has threequarters cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dex saving throws). The only way to negate this benefit is for a character to ready an action and attack the cave eel with a reaction as it extends its body to strike.

***Viselike Jaws.*** When a cave eel withdraws back into its burrow with a grappled character in its jaws, that character's body effectively becomes a shield protecting the eel, giving it total cover inside its burrow (it has only three-quarters cover against the character it grapples). While the eel has a character grappled this way, it doesn't need to extend from its burrow to attack the grappled character, who it bites automatically.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage and the target is grappled and restrained (see Viselike Jaws, above).
