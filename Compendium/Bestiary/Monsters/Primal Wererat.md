### Traits
***Shapechanger.*** The wererat's natural form is that of a humanoid. Any humanoid's statistics can serve as the wererat's natural form. The wererat can't voluntarily change shape, it automatically changes to its beast form after sundown on every full moon night and changes back to humanoid form at first sunlight. The transformation takes two rounds, and the wererat is incapacitated while transforming. Gear is not transformed, and worn items are likely to break. Magic items instead simply fall off. In humanoid form, the wererat uses its humanoid form's statistics, except it has the wererat's Keen Smell and Shapechanger ability. When changing shape, the wererat retains the difference between its current hit points and hit point maximum from the previous form if the current hit points are lower. If the wererat is killed in beast form, it dies in that form and does not revert to humanoid form.

***Keen Smell.*** The wererat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The wererat makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 1d8+4}) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with primal wererat lycanthropy.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage.
