### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The babau makes two melee attacks. It can also use Weakening Gaze before or after making these attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ( 1d8+4) slashing damage.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( 1d6+4) piercing damage, or 8 ( 1d8+4) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Weakening Gaze.*** The babau targets one creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
