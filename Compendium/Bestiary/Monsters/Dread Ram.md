### Traits
***Dreadful Charge.*** If the dread ram moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dread ram can make one attack with its hooves against it as a bonus action. Other creatures of the dread ram's choice within 30 feet of it must then succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the dread ram for one minue. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the frightened effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the frightened effect of the dread ram's Dreadful Charge for the next 24 hours.

### Actions
***Ram.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Cold Flame Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The dread ram exhales a 15 foot cone of unnatural green flame. Creatures in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
