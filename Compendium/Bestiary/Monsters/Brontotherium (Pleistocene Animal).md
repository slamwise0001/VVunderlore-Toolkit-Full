### Traits
***Wounded Fury.*** While a brontotherium's hit points are below half of its starting number, the brontotherium has tactical advantage on attack rolls, the DC to avoid its trample increases to 19, and it rerolls all 1s, 2s, and 3s rolled on its damage dice.

***Trample.*** As the brontotherium moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies up to Large size. Creatures in spaces the brontotherium enters can attempt DC 17 Dexterity saving throws. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 ({@dice 2d10+ 6}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet out of the brontotherium's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. A brontotherium can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round and it can't end its movement in another creature's space.

### Actions
***Gore.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+6}) piercing damage.
