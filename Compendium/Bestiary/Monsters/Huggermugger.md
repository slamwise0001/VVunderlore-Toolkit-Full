### Traits
***Confusion Aura (1/Day).*** When three huggermuggers gather in a group, they automatically generate an aura of confusion. All creatures within 40 feet of any one of the huggermuggers must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be affected the same as if by a confusion spell for {@dice 1d6} rounds. Each of the huggermuggers generating the effect must be no more than 30 feet from both of the other two; if one of them moves outside that range or is killed, incapacitated, or knocked unconscious, the aura and the effect end immediately. If another huggermugger is within range of the other two, however, it can instantly assume the fallen huggermugger's role in maintaining the confusion aura, so there is no break in the aura's effect. An individual huggermugger can contribute to creating one confusion aura per day. A creature that successfully saves against the aura is immune to all huggermugger confusion auras until the end of their next long rest.

***Cunning.*** Huggermuggers possess cunning and logical ability far beyond what their nominal Intelligence and Wisdom scores imply. They never lose their bearings in any setting, they are never surprised, and they can automatically follow any trail that's less than 24 hours old. They have tactical advantage on Wis (Survival) checks to follow a trail that's more than 24 hours old.

### Actions
***Shortsword.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.

***Sling.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, range 30 ft./120 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) bludgeoning damage.
