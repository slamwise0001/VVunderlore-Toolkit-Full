### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The morkoth can breathe air and water.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The morkoth makes three attacks: two with its bite and one with its tentacles or three with its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( 2d6+2) slashing damage.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ( 3d8+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends. the target is restrained and takes 15 ( 3d8+2) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the morkoth's turns. and the morkoth can't use its tentacles on another target.

***Hypnosis.*** The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the morkoth for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the target tries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the morkoth's Hypnosis for 24 hours.
