### Traits
***Feed.*** When the nabassu uses its multiattack to attack a single humanoid creature that is incapacitated, it tears chunks of flesh from the creature's body and consumes them. If this kills the humanoid, the nabassu regains 4 ({@dice 1d8}) hit points, gains 3 temporary hit points and gains advantage on attack rolls for an hour. If a juvenile nabassu consumes 30 humanoids or more, it permanently transforms into a mature nabassu. The body of a humanoid slain by a nabassu's feed ability is too damaged to be revived with a revivify or raise dead spell.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nabassu makes three melee attacks: two with its claws and one with its bite.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) piercing damage.
