### Traits
***Elemental Vulnerability.*** Lava children take 1 extra damage per damage die from spells of the tempest domain. They are unaffected (either directly or indirectly) by spells of the transmutation school.

***Metal Immunity.*** Lava children are completely unaffected by metal. They can walk through metal doors or bars as if the metal wasn't there, and metal objects and weapons, including magic weapons, pass right through a lava child's body without affecting it in any way. Because of this, a lava child also has tactical advantage on melee attack rolls against targets wearing armor that is predominantly metal.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A lava child bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) bludgeoning damage. If the lava child bites the same creature that it hit with its claws this turn, its bite does an additional 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage.
