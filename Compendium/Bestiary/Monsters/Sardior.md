### Traits
***Divine Resurrection.*** When Sardior dies, his body vanishes in a shower of ruby scales and his essence merges with that of his oldest thane (Hrodel). This thane retreats to safety and begins the slow transformation into Sardior, retaining her old memories and gaining Sardior's. All remaining thanes instantly sense Sardior's death.

***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If Sardior fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Limited Magic Immunity.*** Unless he wishes to be affected, Sardior is immune to spells of 6th level or lower. He has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical or psionic effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Sardior's weapon attacks and breath weapons are magical.

***Planar Travel.*** Sardior can cast plane shift after spending one hour in uninterrupted meditation.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Sardior can use his Awesome Presence. He then makes four attacks: one with his bite, two with his claws, and one with his tail.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +18} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 31 ({@dice 4d10+9}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +18} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 ({@dice 4d6+9}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +18} to hit, reach 25 ft., up to three targets. Hit: 27 ({@dice 4d8+9}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from Sardior.

***Awesome Presence.*** Perceiving Sardior's divine form overwhelms the minds of mortal creatures. Each creature of Sardior's choice that is within 240 feet of Sardior and aware of him must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Sardior's Awesome Presence for the next 24 hours.
