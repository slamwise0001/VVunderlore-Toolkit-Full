### Traits
***Camouflage.*** Because strangle weed looks like normal seaweed, it can be recognized as hazardous before it attacks only with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

***Strangling.*** As a bonus action, a strangle weed can strangle one creature that was already grappled at the start of the strangle weeds turn. The strangle weed drags the grappled creature underwater and wraps {@dice 1d6} additional fronds around the target, which becomes grappled and restrained. The DC to escape from this grapple equals 10 plus 2 per frond restraining the creature. A restrained creature takes 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, and it can also be targeted by frond attacks. Strangling fronds have AC 10 and can be severed individually by 4 slashing damage each.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A strangle weed makes {@dice 1d4} melee attacks. The number of attacks is determined each round.

***Frond.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Also see Strangling, above.
