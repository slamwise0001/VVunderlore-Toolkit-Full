### Traits
***All-Around Vision.*** A gloomcrawler's many eyes allow it to scan quickly in all directions. Attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A gloom crawler attacks ten times with tentacles and bites once. Each tentacle can either slam or constrict.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the gloom crawler. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) piercing damage and the creature is dragged to the gloom crawler's mouth.

***Tentacle Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled.

***Tentacle Constriction.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the gloom crawler at the start of the gloom crawler's turn. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.
