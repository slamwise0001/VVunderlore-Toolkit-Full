### Traits
***Crypt Fatigue.*** A creature infected with crypt fatigue gains one level of exhaustion immediately, and gains one more level every time it fails the DC 12 Constitution saving throw after taking damage from a sepulchral guardian. An infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; with a successful save, it recovers from one level of exhaustion, but with a failed save, it gains one level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the victim no longer has any levels of exhaustion.

***Dread.*** Living creatures with line of sight to one or more sepulchral guardians and within 50 feet of them must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 2d4} rounds. A successful save renders the target immune to any guardians dread for 24 hours.

### Actions
***Glaive.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) slashing damage and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with crypt fatigue (see above).
