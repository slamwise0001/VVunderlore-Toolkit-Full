### Traits
***Brachiation.*** A decapus can move through trees at its climb speed (30 feet per round) by using its tentacles to swing from tree to tree, provided the trees are no more than 10 feet apart.

***Sound Imitation.*** A decapus can mimic the sounds of any creature it has previously encountered with uncanny accuracy, though it can't mimic humanoid speech patterns for more than two or three words at a stretch. The ruse can be detected with a contest between the decapus's Deception and a listener's Insight.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A decapus attacks four times, in any combination of tentacle slams and constriction.

***Tentacle Slam.*** Melee Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ( 1d6+2) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

***Constriction.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by a tentacle at the start of the decapus's turn. Hit: 5 ( 1d6+2) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.
