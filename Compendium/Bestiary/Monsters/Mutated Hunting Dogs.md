### Traits
***Drink Blood.*** If a mutated hunting dog hits a creature with a bite attack while it has advantage on that attack, it can use a bonus action to have the eel tentacles on its face drain the target’s blood. This reduces the maximum hits points of the creature by 1. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The mutated hunting dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The mutated hunting dog has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dog’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
