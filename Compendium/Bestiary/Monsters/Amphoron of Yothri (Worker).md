### Traits
***Flicker.*** Roll {@dice 1d6} for every amphoron in play at the start of its turn. On a roll of 1, the amphoron "flickers" due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. Flickering lasts until the start of the amphoron's next turn. While flickering, the amphoron can't be attacked and can't inflict damage. It regains 2 hit points when it rematerializes. A controller flickers only on a roll of 1 on {@dice 1d20}, but if it does, all amphorons under its control also flicker.

***Highly Charged.*** Worker amphorons carry a high static electrical charge. Any living creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a worker amphoron takes 2 electrical damage from static discharge.

***Levitate (1/Day).*** Once per day, a worker amphoron can cast levitate on itself as an action. No components are required.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The amphoron attacks twice with pincers.

***Pincers.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8}) piercing damage.
