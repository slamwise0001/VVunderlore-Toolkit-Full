### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The shadow can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. 

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action. 

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Actions
***Strength Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
