### Traits
***Discord.*** As an attack, a carbuncle can telepathically sow discord in one creature within 30 feet. An affected creature must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him or her. Meaningful communication is impossible. If creatures of different alignments are affected and bickering, each has a 30% chance that they feel compelled to attack the person they are bickering with who is the most different in alignment. Bickering lasts {@dice 5d4} rounds. Fighting (if it occurs) begins {@dice 1d4} rounds into the bickering and lasts {@dice 2d4} rounds.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 ({@dice 1d4}) piercing damage.
