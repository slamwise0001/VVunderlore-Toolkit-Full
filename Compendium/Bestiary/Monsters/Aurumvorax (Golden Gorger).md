### Traits
***Locking Jaws.*** When the aurumvorax bites a creature and locks its jaws, the aurumvorax enters that creature's space. The aurumvorax can't move on its own while its jaws are locked, but it moves with the other creature. To get free from the aurumvorax, the target creature or an adjacent ally must use its action to make a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. The aurumvorax can't use its bite attack again until it releases its jaws, which automatically moves it out of that creature's space.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The aurumvorax bites once and attacks twice with its claws. If the aurumvorax has its jaws locked onto a target, it rakes that target instead of biting.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d8+5}) piercing damage, and the aurumvorax locks its jaws onto the target (see below).

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.

***Rake.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 0 ft., one creature the aurumvorax's jaws were locked onto at the start of the aurumvorax's turn. Hit: 21 ({@dice 4d6+5}) slashing damage.
