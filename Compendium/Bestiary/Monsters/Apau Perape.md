### Traits
***Diseased Ichor.*** Every time the apau perape takes piercing or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the wound toward the attacker. This spray forms a line 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. The first creature in the line must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected by Mechuiti's Ichor disease. The creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the Constitution saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 2d4}). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Magic Resistance.*** The apau perape has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The apau perape makes one bite attack and two claw attacks. Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The apau perape chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. The apau perape has a 50 percent chance of summoning one apau perape or one giant ape.
