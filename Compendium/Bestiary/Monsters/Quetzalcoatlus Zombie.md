### Traits
***Standing Leap.*** The quetzalcoatlus zombie's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Undying Hunger (1/Turn).*** If the quetzalcoatlus zombie hits a creature with a bite attack, the quetzalcoatlus zombie gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 3d6+2}) piercing damage.

***Deadly Leap.*** . If the quetzalcoatlus zombie jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 12 ({@dice 3d6+2}) bludgeoning damage plus 12 ({@dice 3d6+2}) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the quetzalcoatlus zombie's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the quetzalcoatlus zombie's space.
