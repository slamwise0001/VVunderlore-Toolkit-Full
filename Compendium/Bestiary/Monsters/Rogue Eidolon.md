### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The eidolon makes two attacks with its slam.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or become confused. At the start of each of its turns, a confused creature must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or must act as if affected by a confusion spell. This condition is permanent and can only be healed by a heal, greater restoration or wish spell.

***Blood Spray (Recharge 6).*** The eidolon sprays a gout of blood from the carvings in the front of its faceless head at a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or launch into a murderous frenzy, seeing its friends and allies as hated enemies. A frenzied creature must attack its closest ally to the best of its ability. The frenzy prevents it from casting spells and maintaining concentration, but does not prevent it from using magic items, such as wands or scrolls. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
