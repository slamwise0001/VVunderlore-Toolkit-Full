### Traits
***Fiendish Blessing.*** The AC of the cambion includes its Charisma bonus.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:  +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( 1d6+4) piercing damage, or 8 ( 1d8+4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 ( 1d6) fire damage.

***Fire Ray.*** Ranged Spell Attack:  +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( 3d6) fire damage.

***Fiendish Charm.*** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
