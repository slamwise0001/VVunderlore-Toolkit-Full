### Traits
***Variations.*** Four kinds of rageborn exist with diverse abilities, these are frosthurlers, barbclaws, ambushers and horrors. When an ability specifies one of these types, only that type of rageborn has this ability.

***Ambush (Ambusher only, 1/Turn).*** The rageborn deals an extra 7 ({@dice 2d6}) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll.

***Savage Marking (Barbclaw only).*** If the rageborn hits a creature with its claws, it can mark that creature. The rageborn has advantage on attack rolls against a creature it marked. If it marks another creature, the previous creature is no longer marked.

***Ice Aura (Frosthurler only).*** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the rageborn must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 ({@dice 2d8}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Reckless Charge (Horror only).*** If the rageborn moves at least 15 feet in a straight line and hits with a claw, it deals an additional 7 ({@dice 2d6}) slashing damage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The rageborn makes claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) slashing damage.

***Abyssal Fire (Ambusher only, Recharge 5â€”6).*** Creatures within 15 ft. of the rageborn must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@dice 5d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The affected area catches on fire, even if it is not flammable. As long as the area is burning, any creature entering the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 ({@dice 3d8}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Rageborn ambushers are immune to this damage.

***Choking Vapors (Barbclaw only, Recharge 6).*** Creatures within 15 ft. of the rageborn must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for one round and taking 22 ({@dice 5d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
