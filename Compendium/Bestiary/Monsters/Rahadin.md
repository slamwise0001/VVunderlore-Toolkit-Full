### Traits
***Deathly Choir.*** Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a {@spell mind blank} spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed. As a bonus action, Rahadin can force all creatures that can hear the screams to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Each creature takes 16 ({@dice 3d10}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Fey Ancestry.*** Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

***Mask of the Wild.*** Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Rahadin attacks three times with his scimitar, or twice with his poisoned darts.

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d6+6}) slashing damage.

***Poisoned Dart.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d4+6}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@dice 2d4}) poison damage.
