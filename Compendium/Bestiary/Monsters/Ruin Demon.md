### Traits
***Swarm.*** The ruin demon can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the demon can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny ruin fly. The ruin demon can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Agressive Swarming.*** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ruin demon must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@dice 2d6}) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ruin demon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 28 ({@dice 8d6}) piercing damage, or 14 ({@dice 4d6}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Infest (1/Day).*** The ruin flies burrow into a creature the ruin demon is sharing space with. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by the ruin demon. While the creature is charmed, it takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns and the ruin demon has a telepathic link to it which the ruin demon can use to issue commands to the creature as if the creature were under the effect of a dominate monster spell. The effect ends if the ruin demon or the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, or the creature is targeted by a restoration spell or similar magic.
