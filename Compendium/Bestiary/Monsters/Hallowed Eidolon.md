### Traits
***Idol of Worship.*** Allies within 30 feet of the eidolon are immune to the frightened condition and have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

***Divine Retribution.*** While the eidolon's hallowed stance is in effect, if the eidolon takes damage or an ally of the eidolon is reduced to 0 hit points, the eidolon can as a reaction force the creature that caused the damage to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@dice 4d8}) radiant damage on a failed save.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The eidolon makes two attacks with its slam.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Hallowed Stance.*** The eidolon assumes a meditative stance, until the end of the eidolon's next turn its allies' weapon attacks deal an additional 3 ({@dice 1d6}) radiant damage and the eidolon gains reistance to all types of damage. If the eidolon moves, the effect ends.
