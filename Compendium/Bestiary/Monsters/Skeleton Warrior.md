### Traits
***Crypt Fatigue.*** A creature infected with crypt fatigue gains one level of exhaustion immediately, and gains one more level every time it fails the DC 16 Constitution saving throw after taking damage from a skeleton warriors longbow. An infected creature must make another DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; with a successful save, it recovers from one level of exhaustion, but with a failed save, it gains one level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the victim no longer has any levels of exhaustion.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** The skeleton warrior can choose to change a failed saving throw to an automatic success.

***Track Circlet.*** A skeleton warrior can track and find its circlet unerringly. It can also find the last person who possessed the circlet.

***Unholy Fortitude.*** Skeleton Warriors are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A skeleton warrior attacks three times with its greatsword or twice with its longbow.

***Greatsword +2.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d6+7}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 150 ft./600 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d12+1}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be infected with crypt fatigue (see above).

***Attack.*** The skeleton warrior attacks once with its greatsword or longbow.

***Drain Life.*** {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be infected with crypt fatague. If already infected, a failed saving throw causes the creature to gain another level of fatigue.

***Instill Dread.*** One living creature within 50 feet of the skeleton warrior, which the skeleton warrior can see, must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 2d4} rounds. A successful save renders the target immune to this skeleton warriors dread for 24 hours.
