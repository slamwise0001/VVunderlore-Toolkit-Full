### Traits
***Amorphous and Incorporeal.*** An ectoplasm can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can also move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The ectoplasm takes {@dice 1d10} force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

***Glow.*** An ectoplasm continually gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle. It can't consciously extinguish this light. When an ectoplasm is killed, its light fades to darkness.

***Silent.*** An ectoplasm has tactical advantage on Stealth checks when those detecting it are depending chiefly on sound.

***Undead Bane.*** An ectoplasm deals double damage against corporeal undead.

### Actions
***Touch.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) psychic damage and the target gains one level of exhaustion. This attack has tactical advantage against targets wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Ectoplasm (Recharge 4â€”6).*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, all creatures in cone. Hit: targeted creatures must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for {@dice 1d6} rounds. A successful save renders a creature immune to that creature's ectoplasm's attack for 24 hours.
