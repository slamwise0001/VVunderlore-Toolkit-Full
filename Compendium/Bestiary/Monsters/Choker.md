### Traits
***Quickness.*** The choker may make a dash action or a single tentacle attack as a bonus action.

***Ruin Camouflage.*** The choker has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in stone buildings, ruins and in caves.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The choker makes two tentacle attacks.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ( 1d6+3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the choker can automatically hit the target with its tentacle attacks, and the choker can't make tentacle attacks against another target. Because the choker seizes the victims neck, the creature can't breathe, speak or cast spells with verbal components.
