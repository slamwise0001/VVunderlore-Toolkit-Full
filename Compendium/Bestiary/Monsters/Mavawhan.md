### Traits
***Magic Weapons.*** The mavawhan's weapon attacks are magical.

***Magic Resistance.*** The mavawhan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The mavawhan makes two claw attacks.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage puls 10 ({@dice 3d6}) cold damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving or become poisoned. While poisoned, the creature slowly turns into ice and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified (although it turns into ice rather than stone) until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Creatures that are normally immune to petrification are not immune to this ability.
