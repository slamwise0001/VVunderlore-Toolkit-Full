### Traits
***Lifesense.*** A cimota notices and locates all living creatures within 60 ft., without effort or error.

***Magic Proof.*** A cimota automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells and magic effects unless it chooses not to.

***Manifestation.*** As an action, a cimota can transport itself from any point on the Material Plane to another point within its defined area or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota can also lurk on the Negative Plane, prepared to manifest on the Material Plane if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area the cimota is doomed to guard. A cimota can't attack or move in the round in which it manifests"it is effectively stunned until the start of its next turn. When it manifests, it appears as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesces into its cloaked and hooded form. Until the start of its next turn (the round after it manifests), its shifting form has the effect of a blur spell.

***Unholy Existence.*** Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in {@dice 1d6} days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or by destroying the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently.

***Unnatural Aura.*** All animals, wild or trained, become frightened when a cimota is within 30 feet. Trained animals will approach closer if their master makes a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The check allows trained animals to approach the cimota but does not eliminate the tactical disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls because of fright.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A Cimota attacks twice with Scimitars

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) slashing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) lightning damage.

***Dark Fury (Recharge 5â€”6).*** As a bonus action, a high cimota can generate a field of necrotic energy in the form of black lightning. This energy can be shaped into either a 20-foot radius sphere with the high cimota at its center, or as a 100-foot line extending from the high cimota's fingertips. Dark fury inflicts 28 ({@dice 6d8}) necrotic damage on every living creature in its area of effect; a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw negates the damage. Undead, constructs and other nonliving targets are unaffected by dark fury.
