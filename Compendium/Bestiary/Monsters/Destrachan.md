### Traits
***Echolocation.*** The destrachan can't use its blindsight and is completely blind while deafened.

***Keen Hearing.*** The destrachan has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Protection from Sonics. The destrachan has advantage on saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The destrachan makes two claw attacks.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d4+4}) slashing damage.

***Destructive Harmonics.*** The destrachan can sound a destructive screech in a 60-foot cone, which it can modulate to be especially effective for rending flesh or breaking materials. Creatures other than constructs in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@dice 4d8}) thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The destrachan can choose to make its screech nonlethal. If it does, creatures reduced to 0 hit points or less by the sonic damage fall unconscious and stabilize automatically even if the damage would be enough to kill them outright. The destrachan can instead choose to damage objects made primarily made of one material of its choice. The choices are wood, metal, or stone. Instead of the creature taking damage, on a failed save, weapons and armor made of the chosen material the creature is carrying or wearing break. A nonmagical weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage and a nonmagical armor or shield take a cumulative -1 penalty to the armor class it offers (this penalty cannot reduce the armor class below 10 or 10 + Dexterity bonus). A construct made primarily from the chosen material takes 27 ({@dice 6d8}) thunder damage or half as much damage on a successful save.
