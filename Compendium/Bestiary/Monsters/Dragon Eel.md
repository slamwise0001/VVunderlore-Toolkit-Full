### Traits
***Limited Amphibiousness.*** The dragon eel can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every six hours to avoid suffocation.

***Shocking Touch.*** A dragon eel's body generates a potent charge of lightning. A creature that touches or makes a successful melee attack against a dragon eel takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) lightning damage.

***Storm Glide.*** During storms, the dragon eel can travel through the air as if under the effects of a fly spell, except using its swim speed.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon eel makes one bite attack and one tail slap attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 26 ({@dice 4d8+8}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) lightning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for {@dice 1d4} rounds.

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 ({@dice 5d8+8}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) lightning damage and push the target up to 10 feet away.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 6).*** The dragon eel exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each target in that line takes 55 ({@dice 10d10}) lightning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.
