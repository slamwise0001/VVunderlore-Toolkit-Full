### Traits
***Searing Armor.*** The razerblast's armor is hot. Any creature grappling the razerblast or grappled by it takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) fire damage at the end of that creature's turn.

***Shrapnel Explosion.*** When the razerblast drops to 0 hit points, a flaming orb in its chest explodes, destroying the razerblast's body and scattering its armor as shrapnel.
