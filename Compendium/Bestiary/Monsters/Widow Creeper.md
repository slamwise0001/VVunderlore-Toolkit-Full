### Traits
***Charm Plants.*** All plant creatures with Intelligence 3 or higher that come within 50 feet of a widow creeper must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it for 24 hours.

***Entangle (recharge 6).*** As a bonus action, a widow creeper can cast the spell entangle (DC 13 to escape).

***Plantsense.*** A widow creeper can pinpoint the location of anything within 120 feet that is in contact with vegetation. This ability functions identically to tremorsense, but uses plants as its medium instead of earth.

***Woodland Stride.*** A widow creeper can move through thorns, briars, dense brush, and similar terrain at its normal speed without being hindered, slowed down, or injured. This includes terrain that is magically manipulated.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A widow creeper attacks twice.

***Vines.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature,. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage. If both vine attacks hit the same target, the creature must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.

***Brain Fluid Drain.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one restrained or grappled creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d8+5}) piercing damage and the target loses 1 point of Intelligence.

***Webs (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, range 30 ft./60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by plant-fiber webs. A webbed creature can use its action to attempt a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to escape. The web can also be destroyed by 15 points of slashing or fire damage against AC 10.
