### Traits
***Trample.*** As the mastodon moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies up to Large size. Creatures in spaces the mastodon enters can attempt DC 16 Dexterity saving throws. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ({@dice 3d10+6}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet out of the mastodon's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. A mastodon can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round and it can't end its movement in another creature's space.

### Actions
***Gore.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 ({@dice 3d10+6}) piercing damage.
