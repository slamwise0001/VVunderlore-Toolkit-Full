### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The nethui can breathe both air and water.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nethui makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) piercing damage.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. The nethui has three tentacles, each of which can grapple one Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the tentacle can't attack another target. If grappling a Large or larger creature, the nethui must use all tentacles to grapple the target and can't make any weapon attacks against another target.

***Fascinating Form (Recharge 5—6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the nethui that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or be incapacitated for one minute as it is transfixed by the nethui's motions. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.

***Domination (Recharge 4—6).*** A creature the nethui can see within 60 feet of the nethui must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. While charmed, the creature must obey the nethui's telepathic or verbal commands. The nethui must maintain concentration on its charm. It can concentrate on up to 3 charmed creatures at a time. If it fails a concentration check, it loses control over one randomly determined creature instead of all of them.
