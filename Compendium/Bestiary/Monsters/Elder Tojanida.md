### Traits
***Ink Jet (Recharge 6).*** The tojanida emits a stream of ink (no action required). If emitted under water, this ink form's a cloud in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the tojanida. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. Emitted outside of water, the ink is shot at a creature of the tojanida's choice within 30 feet of the tojanida. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded. A creature can use an action to clear the ink off its eyes, ending the condition on itself.

***Direction Change.*** The tojanida can use the Disengage action as a bonus action.

***Withdraw.*** Instead of moving, the tojanida can withdraw into its armored shell. The tojanida has an AC of 23 until the start of its next turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The tojanida makes three melee attacks: onewith its bite, and two with its pincers.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 3d6+5}) piercing damage.

***Pincer.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 3d4+5}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Small or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). The tojanida has two pincers, each of which can grapple one Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the tojanida can't use the pincer against another target.
