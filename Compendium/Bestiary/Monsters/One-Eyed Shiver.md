### Traits
***Chilling Mist.*** While it is alive, the one-eyed shiver projects an aura of cold mist within 10 feet of itself. If the one-eyed shiver deals damage to a creature in this area, the creature also takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) cold damage.

### Actions
***Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage.

***Eye of Frost.*** The one-eyed shiver casts ray of frost from its missing eye. If it hits, the target is also restrained. A target restrained in this way can end the condition by using an action, succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.
