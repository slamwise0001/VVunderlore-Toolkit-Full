### Traits
***Lunge.*** A ghost ammonite can extend its reach to 15 feet at will, but if it does, attacks against it have tactical advantage until the start of the ghost ammonite's next turn.

***Shell Retreat.*** If a ghost ammonite suffers radiant damage, it retreats into its shell for {@dice 1d6} rounds. While withdrawn inside its shell, its AC increases to 16 and it heals 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns, but it can't attack.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A ghost ammonite attacks three times with tentacles.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) necrotic damage and the target's maximum number of hit points is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage.
