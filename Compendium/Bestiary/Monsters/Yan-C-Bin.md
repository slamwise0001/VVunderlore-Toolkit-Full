### Traits
***Air Form.*** Yan-C-Bin can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing if air could pass through that space.

***Empowered Attacks.*** Yan-C-Bin's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Yan-C-Bin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Yan-C-Bin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Yan-C-Bin makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 3d8+7}) force damage plus 10 ({@dice 3d6}) lightning damage.

***Thundercrack (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Yan-C-Bin unleashes a terrible thundercrack in a 100-foot radius sphere centered on himself. All other creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 31 ({@dice 9d6}) thunder damage and be deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is deafened until the start of Yan-C-Bin's next turn.

***Change Shape.*** Yan-C-Bin polymorphs into a Medium humanoid. While in polymorphed form, a swirling breeze surrounds him, his eyes are pale and cloudy, and he loses the Air Form trait. He can remain in polymorphed form for up to 1 hour. Reverting to his true form requires an action.

***Summon Elementals (1/Day).*** Yan-C-Bin summons up to three air elementals and loses 30 hit points for each elemental he summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Yan-C-Bin, and disappear if Yan-C-Bin is reduced to 0 hit points.

### Legendary Actions
***Peal of Thunder.*** Yan-C-Bin unleashes a peal of thunder that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. Each creature within 30 feet of Yan-C-Bin takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) thunder damage.

***Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).*** Yan-C-Bin magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Anything Yan-C-Bin is wearing or carrying is teleported with him.

***Suffocate (Costs 3 Actions).*** Yan-C-Bin steals the air of one breathing creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target drops to 0 hit points and is dying. On a successful save, the target can't breathe or speak until the start of its next turn.
