### Traits
***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny nemicolopterus zombie. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the swarm to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the swarm drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d6}) piercing damage, or 3 ({@dice 1d6}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Necrotic Droppings (Recharge 6).*** One creature the swarm is directly above must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) necrotic damage.
