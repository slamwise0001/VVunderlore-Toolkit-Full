### Traits
***Grasping Tendrils.*** A creature grappled by a forester's bane can break free by winning a Strength contest against the plant or by inflicting 10 slashing damage against the grappling leaf, thereby severing it from the plant. Grappling leaves have AC 10. Damage done to a leaf is not subtracted from the plant's overall hit points. If a creature is grappled by more than one leaf, each leaf must be severed or overpowered individually. Severed leaves grow back in one week, if the forester's bane survives the fight.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Forester's Bane attacks four times with leaves and six times with stalks.

***Leaf.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature of size Medium or smaller. Hit: the target is grappled and restrained.

***Stalk.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, one creature grappled by a leaf. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) slashing damage.
