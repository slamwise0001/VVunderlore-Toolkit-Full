### Traits
***Water Breathing.*** The mosasaurus can breathe only underwater.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 ({@dice 4d12+7}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the mosasaurus can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The mosasaurus makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mosasaurus, and it takes 17 ({@dice 5d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the mosasaurus' turns.If the mosasaurus takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the mosasaurus must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the mosasaurus. If the mosasaurus dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.
