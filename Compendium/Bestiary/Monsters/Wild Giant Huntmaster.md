### Traits
***Swift Pursuit.*** The huntmaster and a group of up to five other creatures can travel at a fast pace without taking the usual -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) to notice hidden threats. Additionally, the huntmaster can track creatures and still contribute its passive Wisdom (Perception) score to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.

***Elk's Charge.*** If the huntmaster moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 ({@dice 2d10}) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Elk Speech.*** The huntmaster can speak with elks and other types of deer as if under the constant effect of a speak with animals spell.

***Huntmaster's Mark.*** Weapon attacks made by the huntmaster's allies against a creature affected by the huntmaster's hunter's mark spell benefit from the spell's additional damage as if the allies had cast the spell. This ability does not stack with the extra damage from hunter's mark spells cast by other creatures.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The huntmaster makes two pike attacks.

***Pike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) bludgeoning damage.
