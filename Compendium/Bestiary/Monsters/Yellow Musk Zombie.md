### Traits

The exception to this restriction is when the yellow musk creeper separates from the zombie so the zombie can seek out a location for a new creeper to take root.


### Actions
***Fist or Weapon.*** Melee Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ( 1d8+2) bludgeoning damage (type can vary by weapon)
