### Traits
***Earth Glide.*** The igniguana can move through any sort of earth or mineral except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of the igniguana's presence. It provokes an opportunity attack if it leaves a creature's reach while on the surface, but not if it does so while gliding through solid earth. The igniguana can't breathe while surrounded by solid stone or earth, so it can remain underground only for as long as it can hold its breath (15 minutes).

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 4â€”6).*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, creatures in cone. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d8}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
