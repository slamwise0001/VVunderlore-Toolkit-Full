### Traits
***Horn.*** The source of a tentacled horrors power is its horn. If a tentacled horrors horn is removed or destroyed, the creature loses its regeneration ability, cant take legendary actions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls. The horn can be attacked specifically with targeted attacks but not area affects; it has AC 20, 30 hit points, and is immune to all damage types except slashing, bludgeoning, and force damage from spells or magic weapons. The horn can be torn off with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check made by a creature that is grappling the tentacled horror. Damage done to the horn does not reduce the tentacled horrors hit points.

***Regeneration.*** A tentacled horror regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. This ability doesnt function if it took cold or fire damage since its previous turn or if its horn is destroyed or removed. If the horn is damaged, regeneration heals it first.
