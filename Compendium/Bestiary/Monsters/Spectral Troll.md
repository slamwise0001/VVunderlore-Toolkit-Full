### Traits
***Create Spawn.*** A humanoid killed by a spectral troll rises one to three days later as a free-willed specter unless a cleric of the victims religion casts gentle repose or comparable magic on the corpse before it rises.

***Incorporeal.*** A spectral troll can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can also move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The spectral troll takes {@dice 1d10} force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

***Rejuvenation.*** Unless it is permanently destroyed by having its spirit laid to rest, a destroyed spectral trolls spirit restores itself to unlife in {@dice 2d4} days.

***Silent.*** A spectral troll makes no sound whatsoever; it is undetectable by purely audial means.

***Unholy Fortitude.*** Spectral trolls are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

***Vanish in Sunlight.*** A spectral troll that begins its turn in bright sunlight is banished to a remote, unknown dimension. It returns, near the same spot, when that location is no longer in direct sunlight. Only true sunlight has this effect; magical light does nothing.

### Actions
***Corrupting Touch.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 ({@dice 4d8+4}) necrotic damage. Creatures immune to aging are immune to this attack.
