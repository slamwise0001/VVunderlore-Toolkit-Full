### Traits
***Lightning Blood.*** A creature within 5 feet of the death kiss takes 5 ( 1d10) lightning damage whenever it hits the death kiss with a melee attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The death kiss makes three tentacle attacks. Up to three of these attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain, one replacement per tentacle grappling a creature

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( 3d6+4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the death kiss can't use the same tentacle on another target. The death kiss has ten tentacles.

***Blood Drain.*** One creature grappled by a tentacle of the death kiss must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 ( 4d10) lightning damage, and the death kiss regains half as many hit points.
