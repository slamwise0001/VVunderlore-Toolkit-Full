***Keen Smell.*** The serpopard has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pounce.*** If the serpopard moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the serpopard can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
