### Traits
***Arctic Hunter.*** Beli have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and Wisdom (Perception) checks made in icy, natural surroundings.

***Cold Regeneration.*** As long as the temperature is below freezing, the beli regains 3 hit points at the start of its turn. If the beli takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the beli's next turn. The beli dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and it doesn't regenerate.

***Flyby.*** The beli doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

### Actions
***Ice Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) piercing damage plus 2 ({@dice 1d4}) cold damage.

***Icy Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) piercing damage plus 2 ({@dice 1d4}) cold damage, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of exhaustion from the arrow's icy chill. If the save succeeds, the target also becomes immune to further exhaustion from beli arrows for 24 hours (but any levels of exhaustion already gained remain in effect). A character who gains a sixth level of exhaustion doesn't die automatically but drops to 0 hit points and must make death saving throws as normal. The exhaustion lasts until the target recovers fully from the cold damage.
