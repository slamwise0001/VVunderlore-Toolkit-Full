### Traits
***Innocent Appearance.*** A patch of flowershroud looks completely natural to the untrained eye. They always have tactical advantage on Stealth checks, and their Stealth is opposed by the observer's Nature skill, not Perception. Shroudblossom Poison: A character who fails a DC 11 Constitution saving throw when struck by a flowershroud's thorn strand attack falls prone and goes into convulsions lasting {@dice 1d6} rounds unless the poison effect is ended early with magic. During that time, the character can't stand up or move, is incapacitated, and takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A flowershroud attacks three times with thorn strands.

***Thorn Strand.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be affected by shroudblossom poison (see above).
