### Traits
***Duplication (Psionics).*** As a bonus action, the berbalang manifests an exact duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of itself. This duplicate is identical to the berbalang in all aspects except the following: Whenever a berbalang manifests a duplicate it loses 40 hit points, and the duplicate manifests with 40 maximum hit points. All damage the duplicate deals with any of its actions is psychic damage, and the duplicate cannot manifest or absorb other duplicates. The duplicate acts on the berbalang's initiative on the following turns. The berbalang can't manifest a duplicate if this would reduce the berbalang to 0 hit points or less.
