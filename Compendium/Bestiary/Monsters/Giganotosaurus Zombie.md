### Traits
***Disgorge Zombie.*** As a bonus action, the giganotosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal {@creature zombie}, which appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of it. The disgorged zombie acts on its own initative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the giganotosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. On a roll of 6, the next zombie the giganotosaurus zombie disgorges is an {@creature ogre zombie}. If the giganotosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, {@dice 1d4} normal {@creature zombie}s erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initative counts.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The giganotosaurus zombie can make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can use Swallow instead of its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 34 ({@dice 4d12+8}) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the giganotosaurus zombie can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 26 ({@dice 4d8+8}) bludgeoning damage.

***Swallow.*** The giganotosaurus zombie makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the giganotosaurus zombie, and it takes 18 ({@dice 4d6}) poison damage at the start of each of the giganotosaurus zombie's turns. A creature that dies while swallowed becomes a {@creature zombie} the giganotosaurus zombie can disgorge at the start of the giganotosaurus zombie's next turn.If the giganotosaurus zombie takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the giganotosaurus zombie must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the giganotosaurus zombie. If the giganotosaurus zombie dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Legendary Actions
***Disgorge Zombie.*** The giganotosaurus zombie disgorges a zombie.

***Tail Sweep.*** (2 Actions) The giganotosaurus zombie sweeps its tail in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Roar (3 Actions).*** Creatures within 20 feet of the giganotosaurus zombie that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the giganotosaurus zombie until the end of its next turn.
