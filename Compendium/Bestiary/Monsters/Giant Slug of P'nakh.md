### Traits
***Smothering.*** When a giant slug of P'nahk hits a creature with its crushing attack, it drops its body onto the creature, pinning it to the ground. Treat this as being grappled and restrained, but the creature must also make an immediate DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A successful saving throw indicates the creature inhaled a lungful of air before being trapped; a failed saving throw indicates the air was forced from the creature's lungs and it is suffocating. A suffocating creature can act normally for a number of rounds equal to its Con modifier (minimum of 1 round). Once those rounds expire, the creature drops to 0 hit points at the start of its next turn and it must make death saving throws.
