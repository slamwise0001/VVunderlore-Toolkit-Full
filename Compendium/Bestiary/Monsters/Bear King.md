### Traits
***Alternate Form.*** As a bonus action, the Bear King can assume the form of a shaggy grizzly bear, or a hybrid of his humanoid and bear forms. In alternate form the Bear King's size increases to Large, and he can make bite and claw attacks. He remains in this form until he returns to human form as a bonus action or he falls unconscious or dies.

***Keen Smell.*** The Bear King has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Bear King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Regeneration (Alternate Form Only).*** The Bear King regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bear king makes two ranged attacks or two melee attacks. In hybrid or grizzly bear form he can also make one additional bite attack.

***Bite (Grizzly or Hybrid Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) piercing damage. A target creature other than a construct or undead must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or lose 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points from blood loss. Each time the Bear King hits the wounded creature with this attack, the hit point loss increases by 10 ({@dice 3d6}). A creature can take an action to staunch the bleeding on itself or an adjacent ally with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The bleeding also stops if the creature receives any magical healing.

***Claws (Grizzly or Hybrid Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.

***Maul (Human or Hybrid Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) bludgeoning damage. A creature hit by two maul attacks in the same turn must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

***Javelin (Human Form Only).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d6+5}) piercing damage.

### Legendary Actions
***Melee Attack.*** The Bear King makes a claw or maul attack.

***Honey Toss.*** The Bear King reaches into the jar he carries at his side and hurls a glob of honey at a target within 30 feet as a ranged weapon attack ({@hit +9} to hit). If the attack hits, the creature is restrained (escape DC 17).

***Frightful Roar (2 actions).*** The Bear King lets out a blood-curdling roar. All creatures within 90 feet who can hear the Bear King must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature that makes its save, or who the effect ends for, is immune to the Frightful Roar for 24 hours. The bear king's allies are unaffected.
