### Traits
***Adrenal Surge (2/Day).*** Twice per day as a bonus action, an encephalon gorger can accelerate itself so that it gains speed 60 ft. and AC 15, it gets tactical advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can take one additional action on its turns. This effect lasts {@dice 1d4} rounds.

***Combat Mobility.*** Opportunity attacks against a moving encephalon gorger always have tactical disadvantage.

***Mind Screen.*** The mind of an encephalon gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a creature attempt to scan the mind or read the thoughts of an encephalon gorger with magic or psionics (not just gauging intent with Insight skill), the creature making the attempt must make a successful DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or be driven insane (Intelligence and Wisdom both reduced to 3). Even on a successful save, the creature suffers the effects of a confusion spell for {@dice 1d4} rounds.

***Mindsense.*** An encephalon gorger instinctively senses the Intelligence of any creature within 60 feet.

***Regeneration.*** At the start of its turn, an encephalon regains 5 lost hit points. This ability fails to function if the creature takes psychic damage since its previous turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** An encephalon gorger attacks twice with claws or once with mindfeed. A claw used to maintain a grapple can't attack.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d8+3}) slashing damage and the target is grappled.

***Mindfeed.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the encephalon at the start of its turn. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) psychic damage and the encephalon gains 5 temporary hit points. The target must also make a successful DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or lose 1 point of Intelligence. All drained Intelligence is recovered if greater restoration or comparable magic is used on the victim within 24 hours of the loss. After 24 hours, each casting of greater restoration restores just one point of Intelligence.
