### Traits
***Acidic Blood.*** Every time the isaati takes piercing or slashing damage, all creatures within 5 feet of it take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) acid damage, or 14 ({@dice 4d6}) acid damage if the piercing or slashing damage is from a critical hit.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The isaati makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its fangs.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage.

***Fangs.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage.

***Nauseating Form (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the isaati must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 27 ({@dice 6d8}) poison damage and becoming stunned for one minute on a failed saving throw or taking half as much damage on a successful one as it is overwhelmed with nausea. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
