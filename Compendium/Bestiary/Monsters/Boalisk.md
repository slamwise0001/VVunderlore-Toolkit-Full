### Traits
***Gaze.*** Creatures within 30 feet that meet the boalisk's gaze must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract black rot disease. Creatures with black rot can't spend hit dice to recover lost hit points. A diseased character repeats the Con saving throw at the end of every long rest. On a failed saving throw, the disease continues. With a successful saving throw, the disease ends. The disease can also be cured with a lesser restoration spell.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) piercing damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

***Constriction.*** Melee Waepon Attack: Automatic hit, reach 0 ft., one creature grappled by the boalisk. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d10+3}) bludgeoning damage.
