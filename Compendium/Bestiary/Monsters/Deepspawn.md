### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The deepspawn can breathe air and water.

***Prehensile Tentacles.*** The deepspawn can wield weapons in its prehensile tentacles. Each tentacle can wield a Huge one—handed or Large or smaller one—or two—handed melee weapon. The tentacle attack is then resolved with the weapon's damage die and type as well as its special qualities.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The deepspawn makes three melee attacks with any combination of bites and tentacles.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+6}) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d4+6}) bludgeoning damage. If the tentacle is not wielding a weapon, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The deepspawn has three tentacles, each can grapple a single Large or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the creature is restrained and the deepspawn can't use the tentacle on another target.
