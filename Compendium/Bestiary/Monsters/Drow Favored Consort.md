### Traits
***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***War Magic.*** When the drow uses its action to cast a spell, it can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The drow makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ( 1d6+5) slashing damage plus 18 ( 4d8) poison damage. In addition, the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell the drow casts before the end of the drow's next turn.

***Hand Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack:  +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ( 1d6+5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
