### Traits
***False Appearance.*** While the assassin vine remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal plant.


### Actions
***Constrict.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: The target takes 11 ( 2d6+4) bludgeoning damage, and it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and it takes 21 ( 6d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.

***Entangling Vines.*** The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into difficult terrain. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling vines and roots. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.
