### Traits
***Fear Cackle (1/Day).*** As an action, a red jester can unleash a fear-inducing cackle. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the cackle must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 2d4} rounds. A frightened creature has a 50% chance of immediately dropping everything it holds in its hands.

***Unassailable Mind.*** The mind of a red jester is a twisted and dangerous place to peer into. If a living creature targets a red jester with an attack that normally causes psychic damage, or tries to use telepathy on a red jester, that creature must make a successful DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed, with an effect identical to a permanent confusion spell. The confusion effect can be ended only by magic that lifts the curse.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A red jester attacks twice with fists, or once with its jesters deck, or twice with its mace.

***Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d12+3}) bludgeoning damage.

***Jester's Deck.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 20 ft., one creature. Hit: the target creature is affected as if he or she drew a random card from the Deck of Many Things. In the hands of anyone but a red jester, the jesters deck acts as a normal, nonmagical deck of playing cards.

***+2 Mace of Merriment.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed with Merriment for {@dice 1d3} rounds. In the hands of anyone but a red jester, the weapon acts as a +1 mace.
