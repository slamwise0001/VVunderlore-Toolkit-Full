### Traits
***Premonition.*** The time dragon has advantage on initiative checks and is never surprised.

***Void Travel.*** The dragon does not need to breathe and is immune to the hazards of outer space. It can fly beyond a planet's atmosphere and travel between planets. Travelling between planets using the void travel ability requires {@dice 6d10} days of travel time regardless of the actual distance. Riders it carries while travelling through space are also protected from the void of outer space.

***Temporal Anomaly.*** Up to three times in its life, the dragon can travel to any point in time, taking with it a number of willing creatures equal to its Charisma modifier.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Alien Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +17} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 2d10+10}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d6+10}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +17} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 2d8+10}) bludgeoning damage.

***Slowing Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or have their speed halved and can only take either an action or a bonus action on their turn for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Slowing Presence for the next 24 hours.
