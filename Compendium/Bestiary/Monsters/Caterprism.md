### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A caterprism attacks four times with claws, or once with mandibles, or spews its crystal saliva.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) slashing damage.

***Mandibles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5 }piercing damage). This attack has tactical advantage against targets in armor. If the bite scores a critical hit, the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points instantly. Crystal Saliva (Recharge 6): automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, creatures in range. Hit: 10 ({@dice 3d6}) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, and the affected area becomes difficult terrain for all creatures except caterprisms.
