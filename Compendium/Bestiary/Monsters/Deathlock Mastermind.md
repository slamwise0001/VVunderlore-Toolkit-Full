### Traits
***Turn Resistance.*** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


### Actions
***Deathly Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( 3d6+3 necrotic damage).

***Grave Bolts.*** Ranged Spell Attack:  +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one or two targets. Hit: 18 ( 4d8) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A restrained target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
