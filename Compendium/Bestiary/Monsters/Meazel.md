### Traits
***Disease Carrier.*** The meazel is immune to the ill effects of diseases, but can still be infected and transmit them to other creatures. All meazels carry a skin disease. A creature that touches the meazel, including being hit by its claw attack, must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against this skin disease or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 hour. After one hour the diseased creature gains disadvantage on Dexterity and Constitution checks and saving throws until the disease is cured.

***Natural Swimmer.*** The meazel has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to swim.


### Actions
***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ( 1d6+2) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) slashing damage.

***Garrote.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which the meazel has advantage on the attack roll. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the meazel has advantage on attack rolls against it, the meazel can't use its garrote against another creature, and the target is choked and can't breathe.
