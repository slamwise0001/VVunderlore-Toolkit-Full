### Traits
***Slippery.*** Bloody bones are difficult to grapple or snare because of the constant flow of blood and mucus across their bodies. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect bloody bones. A bloody bones has tactical advantage to escape from a grapple, and enemies trying to escape from its grapple have tactical disadvantage.

***Drag with Tendril.*** As a bonus action, a bloody bones can drag each creature grappled by its tendrils 10 feet directly toward the bloody bones. When a creature grappled by the bloody bones's tendrils is within 5 feet of the bloody bones, it can be clawed automatically (no attack roll is necessary). The bloody bones's tendrils can be attacked separately (AC 13); 6 points of slashing damage severs the tendril. This damage affects only the tendril, however, and doesn't reduce the bloody bones's hit points. The monster generates a new tendril to replace the severed one at the start of its next turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A bloody bones attacks twice with claws or four times with tendrils.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage. This attack hits automatically if the target is grappled by the bloody bones.

***Tendril.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d4}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and can be dragged (see above).
