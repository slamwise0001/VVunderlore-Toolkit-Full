If the dogmole draws blood against vermin, a purple worm, or other underground invertebrates, it gains a +4 boost to its Strength and Constitution, but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. The wormkiller rage lasts for 3 rounds. It cannot end the rage voluntarily while the creatures that sent it into a rage still lives.
