### Traits
***Magic Attacks.*** The golem's weapon attacks and breath weapons are magical.

***Psionic Conduit.*** When Sardior casts a spell with his Innate Spellcasting (Psionics) feature, he can treat any Sardorian golem on the same plane of existence as the spell's point of origin. If he wishes, he can also speak through the mouth of any Sardorian golem on any plane of existence.

***Psychometabolic Shield.*** If the golem and Sardior are within 120 feet of each other, half of any damage Sardior takes is transferred to the golem.
