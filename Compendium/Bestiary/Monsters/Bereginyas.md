### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bereginyas makes two claw attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 12) and the bereginyas immediately uses Smother against it as a bonus action.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) slashing damage.

***Smother.*** If the bereginyas grapples an opponent, it extends a semi-solid gaseous tendril down the target's throat as a bonus action. The target must make a successful DC 14 Strength saving or it is immediately out of breath and begins suffocating. Suffocation ends if the grapple is broken or if the bereginyas is killed.
