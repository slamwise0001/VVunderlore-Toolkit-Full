### Traits
***Corpse Infestation.*** Using all of its movement and its action, the swarm can infest a Medium fresh, preserved, or mummified humanoid corpse in its space, becoming a swarm husk with twice as many current hit points as the swarm's current hit point total.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny parasite worm. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

### Actions
***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 ({@dice 4d4}) piercing damage, or 5 ({@dice 2d4}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
