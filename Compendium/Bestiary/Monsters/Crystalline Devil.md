### Traits
***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The crystalline devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The crystalline devil deals an extra 7 ({@dice 2d6}) damage when it hits a target with an attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the devil that isn't incapacitated and the devil doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two claw attacks.

***Betraying Carbuncle.*** The crystalline devil takes the form of a gemstone worth 500 gp. It radiates magic in this form, but it can't be destroyed. It is fully aware and can see and hear its surroundings. Reverting to its usual form requires another action.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage.

***Crystalline Spray (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The crystalline devil magically sprays shards of crystal in a 15-foot cone. Each target in that area takes 17 ({@dice 7d4}) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

***Variant: Summon Devil (1/Day).*** The crystalline devil has a 25 percent chance of summoning one crystalline devil.
