### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The bonepowder ghoul can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Coalesce.*** Whenever a bonepowder ghoul drains life force from victims with Gravedust, it can use that energy transform its shape into a more solid form and maintain it. The new form is Small and semi-transparent but roughly the shape of a normal ghoul. In this form, the ghoul isn't amorphous and can't form a whirlwind, but it can speak normally and manipulate objects. The altered form lasts for 1 minute for every point of necrotic damage it delivered against living foes.

***Turning Defiance.*** The bonepowder ghoul and any other ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d8+5}) plus {@dice 1d4} Strength damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for {@dice 1d4+1 }rounds. If the target creature is humanoid, it must succeed on a second DC 19 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.

***Gravedust.*** A bonepowder ghoul can project a 40 foot cone of grave dust. All targets within the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking {@dice 4d8} necrotic damage, and must make a second DC 17 Constitution saving throw to avoid being infected with darakhul fever.

***Whirlwind (Recharge 5—6).*** A bonepowder ghoul can generate a whirlwind of bones and teeth. All creatures within a 20-foot cube take 66 ({@dice 12d10}) slashing damage and are drained of {@dice 1d6} Strength; a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the Strength loss. The whirlwind dissipates after one round.

***Darakhul Fever.*** Spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. Failure costs the victim {@dice 1d6} Constitution damage and {@dice 1d4} Dexterity damage. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days, but the accumulating Constitution damage makes this less likely with each passing day. Greater restoration cures the disease; cure disease allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Once the disease is cured, the victim recovers 2 Dexterity points per day naturally, but only magic can restore the lost Constitution.Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible.If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll {@dice 1d20}, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.1—9: None; victim is simply dead10—16: Ghoul17—20: Ghast21+: Darakhul
