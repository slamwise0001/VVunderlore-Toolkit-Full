### Traits
***Flyby.*** The ala doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Poison Flesh.*** The ala's poison infuses its flesh. A creature that makes a successful bite attack against an ala must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the creature takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage.

***Storm's Strength.*** If an electrical storm is raging around an ala and its target, the saving throw against Lightning's Kiss is made with disadvantage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ala makes two claw attacks or one claw and one bite attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 saving throw or take 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage.

***Lightning's Kiss (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 50 ft., one target. Hit: 28 ({@dice 8d6}) lightning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Jagged bolts of lightning flash through and around the ala's whirlwind. It can hurl this lightning with a sudden whipping motion of its tail.
