### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Stomp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 40 ({@dice 6d10+7}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 45 ({@dice 7d10+7}) bludgeoning damage.

### Legendary Actions
***Flesh Drop.*** The titanosaurus zombie chooses one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that it can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained in a mote of the titanosaurus zombie's flesh that has separated from its body. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

***Poison Gas.*** (2 Actions) The titanosaurus zombie breathes gas in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Creatures poisoned this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Tail Thunder.*** (3 Actions) The titanosaurus makes a tail attack with disadvantage against each creature in a 20-foot cone.
