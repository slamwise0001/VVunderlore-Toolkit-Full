### Traits
***Shapechanger.*** The werewolf's natural form is that of a humanoid. Any humanoid's statistics can serve as the werewolf's natural form. The werewolf can't voluntarily change shape, it automatically changes to its beast form after sundown on every full moon night and changes back to humanoid form at first sunlight. The transformation takes two rounds, and the werewolf is incapacitated while transforming. Gear is not transformed, and worn items are likely to break. Magic items instead simply fall off. In humanoid form, the werewolf uses its humanoid form's statistics, except it has the werewolf's Keen Hearing and Smell and Shapechanger ability. When changing shape, the werewolf retains the difference between its current hit points and hit point maximum from the previous form if the current hit points are lower. If the werewolf is killed in beast form, it dies in that form and does not revert to humanoid form. Keen Hearing and Smell. The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The werewolf makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with primal werewolf lycanthropy.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage.
