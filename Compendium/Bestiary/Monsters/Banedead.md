### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The banedead makes two melee attacks, one with its claw and one with its bite.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or it gains disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity checks and saving throws, and its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken until it finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) piercing damage.
