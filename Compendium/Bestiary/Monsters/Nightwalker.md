### Traits
***Evil Gaze.*** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the nightwalker and the two of them can see each other, the nightwalker can force the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw if the nightcrawler isn't incapacitated. The creature becomes frightened on a failed save. While frightened the, creature is paralyzed. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeded on a saving throw against the nightwalker's Evil Gaze is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throws at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the nightwalker until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. Blend with Shadows. The nightshade has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.

***Desecrating Aura.*** Other undead creatures have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on attack rolls and saving throws while within 20 feet of the nightshade.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nightshade has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sunlight Aversion.*** While in natural sunlight (a daylight spell does not suffice), the nightshade has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nightwalker can cast blight. It then makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ( 3d6+8) bludgeoning damage.

***Summon Undead (1/Night).*** The nightshade calls upon undead creatures lurking in the darkness nearby. Within  1d6 rounds,  1d6+6 Shadows (see Monster Manual p. 269) each arrive in an unoccupied space anywhere within 60 feet of the nightshade, serving the nightshade as allies.
