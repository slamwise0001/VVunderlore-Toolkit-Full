### Traits
***Astral Jaunt.*** A corpsespinner can shift between the Astral and Material Planes in either direction as a move. This does not trigger a reaction.

***Astralsense.*** A corpsespinner can automatically sense the presence and location of anything within 200 feet of it on the Astral Plane.

***Create Corpsespun.*** Creatures that die while affected by a corpsespinner's poison (and not devoured by the corpsespinner) rise in 1 hour as a corpsespun.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) poison damage and the target is poisoned. A poisoned creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the condition.

***Web (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 80 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to attempt a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check, becoming free of the webs on a success. A character has tactical disadvantage on this check on the Astral Plane. These webs can be destroyed with slashing damage (AC 12, 10 hp), but they are immune to all other damage, including fire.
