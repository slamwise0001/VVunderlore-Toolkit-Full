### Traits
***Pounce.*** If the zealoraptor zombie moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the zealoraptor zombie can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The zealoraptor makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack. {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack. {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit. 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) slashing damage and the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract sewer plague (see the "Sewer Plague" sidebar or "Diseases" in chapter 8, "Running the Game" of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
