### Traits
***Fixating Form (Recharge 5â€”6).*** As a bonus action the golothoma presents itself. Each creature within 20 feet of the golothoma that can see it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or develop a permanent unhealthy obsession with shadows and shadowy illumination. While in bright light or darkness the creature becomes sickened by discomfort, becoming poisoned until it enters an area of shadowy illumination. This effect can be removed with a dispel evil and good, dispel magic, heal or remove curse spell cast on the subject. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.

***Dimensional Reach.*** When attacking with its claws, the golothoma can reach through bents in space and attack creatures much further away than the length of its limbs may suggest. When taking an attack action or using its multiattack to attack with its claws, the golothoma's claws have a reach of 120 feet.

***Ravenous Shadow.*** At the start of the golothoma's turn each creature within 15 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and becoming poisoned for one round on a failed save or taking half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures have disadvantage on this save while blinded or in darkness.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The golothoma makes five melee attacks: one with its tail and four with its claws.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d6+6}) bludgeoning damage plus 31 ({@dice 9d6}) acid damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) slashing damage.
