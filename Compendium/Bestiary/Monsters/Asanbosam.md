### Traits
***Spider Climb.*** The asanbosam can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Arboreal.*** While up in trees, the asanbosam can take theDisengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The asanbosam makes one bite attack and one claws attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against disease. If the saving throw fails, the target takes 11 ({@dice 2d10}) poison damage immediately and becomes poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw and reduce its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 3d10+4}) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the asanbosam can't claw a different target. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against disease or contract the disease described in the bite attack.
