### Traits
***Pyrophoric Blood.*** A fire drake's blood is highly flammable; it ignites in a burst of flame on contact with air. A creature that makes a successful melee attack with a slashing or piercing weapon (including natural weapons) against a fire drake must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage from the splashing blood.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A fire drake bites once and attacks once with claws, or it uses its breath weapon.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature,. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 2d6+1}) slashing damage.

***Fiery Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The fire drake exhales fire in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 ({@dice 2d10}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
