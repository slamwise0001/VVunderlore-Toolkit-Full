### Traits
***Shapechange.*** The merskarab can use an action to assume the form of an attractive Medium sized humanoidâ€”shaped creature of any type, or back into its true swarm form. Its statistics are the same except that it loses its immunity to the paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions. The swarm's humanoid form can change, resembling any race or gender of humanoid, but the swarm can't convincingly imitate a specific individual except for the host it spawned from.

***Swarm (Swarm Form Only).*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny merskarab beetle. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, except from its bites attack.

### Actions
***Devouring Touch (Humanoid Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and the merskarab regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

***Bites (Swarm Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 ({@dice 3d6}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and the merskarab regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
