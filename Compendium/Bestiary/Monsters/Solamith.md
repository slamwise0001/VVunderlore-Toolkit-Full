### Traits
***Soulfire Retort.*** A creature that hits the solamith with a melee attack must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 ({@dice 5d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The solamith makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Soulfire.*** The Solamith tears a chunk of flesh from its body, taking 5 damage, and throws it at any point within 100 ft. of itself where it explodes. Creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere around the impact point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 ({@dice 5d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The solamith can choose to deal an extra 5 damage to itself to widen the radius of the sphere to 40 feet. It may also choose to deal an extra 10 points of damage to itself to have the soulfire deal 35 ({@dice 10d6}) damage instead.
