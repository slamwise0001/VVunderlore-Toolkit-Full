### Traits
***Chill of the Void.*** Cold damage dealt by the void dragon ignores resistance to cold damage, but not cold immunity.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Void Dweller.*** Void dragons dwell in the empty expanse between the stars, and do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. When flying between stars the void dragon magically glides on solar winds, making the immense journey through the void in an impossibly short time.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Aura of Madness. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d10+7}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d6+7}) slashing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) cold damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d8+7}) bludgeoning damage.

***Aura of Madness.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane creature is frightened permanently, and behaves as if affected by confusion while it is frightened in this way. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours.
