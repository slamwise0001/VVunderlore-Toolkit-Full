### Traits
***Void Travel.*** The dragon does not need to breathe and is immune to the hazards of outer space. It can fly beyond a planet's atmosphere and travel between planets. Travelling between planets using the void travel ability requires {@dice 6d10} days of travel time regardless of the actual distance. Riders it carries while travelling through space are also protected from the void of outer space.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Alien Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage.
