### Traits
***Camouflage.*** A coral drake's coloration and shape lend to its stealth, granting the creature advantage on all Stealth checks while it's underwater.

***Water Breathing.*** The coral drake can breathe only underwater.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The coral drake makes one bite attack, one claw attack, and one stinger attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 ({@dice 4d8+4}) slashing damage.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 4 rounds. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Coral drakes nurture their offspring in specialized throat sacs. They can pressurize these sacs to spew forth a 15-foot cone of spawn. Each target in this area takes 21 ({@dice 6d6}) piercing damage from thousands of tiny bites and is blinded for {@dice 1d4} rounds; a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blindness.
