### Traits
***Choking Dust.*** A creature that hits the grisgol with a melee attack that deals damage other than piercing damage while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or have its hit point maximum reduced by 13 ({@dice 3d8}). Every 24 hours after contracting the disease, the creature must make another Constitution saving throw, having its hit point maximum reduced by another 13 ({@dice 3d8}). The creature's hit point maximum is not restored to its normal maximum until the disease is cured. If a creature's hit point maximum becomes 0, it dies, its insides having turned to infectious goo.

***Immutable Form.*** The grisgol is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The grisgol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The grisgol's claw attacks are magical.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The grisgol makes two attacks with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage plus 10 ({@dice 3d6}) cold damage and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for one minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
