**Challenge**: 5

### Traits
***Amorphous.*** A magma ooze can move through gaps as small as 6 square inches as if it's difficult terrain.

***Split.*** If an attack does 10 or more slashing damage to a magma ooze, a chunk of the ooze is sliced off and becomes an independent magma ooze. The new ooze has hit points equal to the slashing damage caused by the attack, and the parent ooze's hit points are reduced by an equal amount (in addition to the damage caused by the attack). The new ooze makes one slam attack immediately as a reaction against one adjacent foe, then joins the initiative order at the same point as its parent.

***Superheated.*** A magma ooze's form is extremely hot and composed entirely of magma. Creatures that hit a magma ooze with natural weapons or with an unarmed attack take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage per hit. If a hit from a metal weapon causes the minimum possible damage, the weapon melts and is destroyed. A creature grappled by a magma ooze takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage at the start of its own turn.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage, and the target must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (see Superheated, above).
