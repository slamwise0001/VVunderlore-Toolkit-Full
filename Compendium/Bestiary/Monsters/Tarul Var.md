### Traits
***Focused Conjuration.*** While Var is concentrating on a conjuration spell, his concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Var fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Rejuvenation.*** If Var is destroyed but his phylactery remains intact, Var gains a new body in {@dice 1d10} days, regaining all his hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

***Turn Resistance.*** Var has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions
***Paralyzing Touch.*** Melee Spell Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 3d6}) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Benign Transposition.*** Var teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Alternatively, he can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, both creatures teleport, swapping places. Var can use this feature again only after he finishes a long rest or casts a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.

### Legendary Actions
***Cantrip.*** Var casts a cantrip.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** Var uses Paralyzing Touch.

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** Var fixes his gaze on one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Var's gaze for the next 24 hours.
