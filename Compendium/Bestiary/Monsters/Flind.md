### Traits
***Aura of Blood Thirst.*** If the flind isn't incapacitated, any creature with the Rampage trait can make a bite attack as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the flind.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The flind makes three attacks: one with each of its different flail attacks or three with its longbow.

***Flail of Madness.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must make a melee attack against a random target within its reach on its next turn. If it has no targets within its reach even after moving, it loses its action on that turn.

***Flail of Pain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) bludgeoning damage plus 22 ({@dice 4d10}) psychic damage.

***Flail of Paralysis.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d8}) piercing damage.
