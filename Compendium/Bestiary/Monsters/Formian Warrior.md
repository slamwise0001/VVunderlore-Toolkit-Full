### Traits
***Hive Mind.*** Formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant telepathic communication and share experiences and thoughts constantly, when one formian is aware of something, they all are.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The formian makes three melee attacks: one with its claws, one with its bite and one with its sting.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
