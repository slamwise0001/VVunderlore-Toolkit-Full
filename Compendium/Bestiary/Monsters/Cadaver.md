### Traits
***Cadaver Fever.*** At the end of a battle against cadavers, anyone who was clawed or bitten by a cadaver must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease. Failure indicates the character is infected with cadaver fever. An infected character gains one level of exhaustion immediately and must repeat the saving throw at the end of every long rest. Each failed saving throw adds one more level of exhaustion; a successful saving throw at the end of a long rest means only that the character's condition doesn't worsen. The character recovers fully when he or she makes successful saving throws at the ends of two consecutive long rests or when lesser restoration or comparable magic is used on the character.

***Reanimation.*** When reduced to 0 hit points, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it reassembles itself and stands up, ready to fight again. Scattering or even destroying the pieces of its body don't prevent it from magically reassembling and reanimating. If gentle repose is cast on the cadaver when it is at 0 hit points, it can't reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain 1 hit point per minute instead of per round.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cadaver bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+1}) piercing damage and the target may be infected with cadaver fever (see above).

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+1}) slashing damage and the target may be infected with cadaver fever (see above).
