### Traits
***Discorporate.*** At any point during its turn, the larva mage can collapse into a pile of individual worms that slither away, burrowing into the earth or fleeing into cracks in the floor (no action required). As long as any of the worms survive, they can breed and create a new body for the larva mage a few weeks or months later, depending on the amount of damage the larva mage has taken (the exact time is up to DM discretion).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the larva mage fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The larva mage has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Swarm.*** The larva mage can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny larva. However it may have to leave some of its gear behind if the opening is too small.

### Actions
***Corrupting Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., Hit: 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until it finishes a long rest.

***Engulf (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the larva mage's space. Hit: 70 ({@dice 20d6}) piercing damage.

### Legendary Actions
***Cantrip.*** The larva mage casts a cantrip.

***Corrupting Touch.*** The larva mage uses its corrupting touch action. Horrific visage (Costs 2 Actions). The larva mage displays its writhing face to one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the larva mage's visage for the next 24 hours.
