### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The nerra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spell Reflection.*** If the nerra succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect or is missed by a spell attack that only targets the nerra, the nerra takes no damage and the effect or attack is reflected back to the caster, which must make a save against the spell or roll to hit against itself.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nerra makes two shard longsword attacks.

***Shard Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.

***Shard Spray (3/Day).*** The nerra releases a spray of sharp mirror shards in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@dice 3d4}) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Mirror Jump.*** The nerra touches a mirror or any reflective surface within 5 feet of it and immediately is transported to any other such surface within 5 miles. It exits within 5 feet of that surface.
