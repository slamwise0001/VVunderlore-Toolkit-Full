### Traits
***Blood Frenzy.*** A crimson basilisk that detects fresh blood within 30 feet enters a frenzied state at the start of its next turn, as do any other crimson basilisks within 30 feet of the frenzied basilisk. Frenzied crimson basilisks fight until they are slain or until 1 minute has passed without the basilisk being attacked. While frenzied, they gain tactical advantage on attack rolls and saving throws, their acid damage increases to 7 ({@dice 2d8}), and their armor class decreases to 11.

***Stone Camouflage.*** A crimson basilisk has tactical advantage on Stealth checks in a stony environment or when it has a stony background.

***Wounding Gaze.*** A creature within 30 feet of a crimson basilisk that meets the monster's gaze must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the creature takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) points of damage as blood weeps from the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Creatures without blood and other crimson basilisks are immune to this effect. A creature that is capable of taking actions can look away at the start of its turn to avoid the basilisk's gaze, but if it targets the basilisk while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+3}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage (also see Blood Frenzy above).
