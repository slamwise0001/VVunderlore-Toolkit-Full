### Traits
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the klurichir fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Weapons.*** The klurichir's weapon attacks are magical.

***Magic Resistance.*** The klurichir has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The klurichir can use its frightful presence. It then either makes three melee attacks: two with its claws and one with its bite, or two ranged attacks with its spines.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d8+8}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d6+8}) slashing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). The Klurichir has four claws, each of which can grapple a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the claw can't attack another target.

***Spines.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 3d4+8}) piercing damage and 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours.

***Vorpal Pincer.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 41 ({@dice 6d10+8}) piercing damage. On a critical hit the pincer decapitates the target and it dies.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the klurichir's choice that is in a 30-foot radius around the klurichir and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the klurichir's frightful presence for the next 24 hours.

### Legendary Actions
***Spines.*** The klurichir makes an attack with its spines.

***Claw.*** The klurichir makes an attack with a claw that it hasn't used to attack with since the start of its last turn.

***Feed (Costs 2 Actions).*** The klurichir makes an attack with its vorpal pincers against a creature it is grappling. This attack has advantage on the attack roll.
