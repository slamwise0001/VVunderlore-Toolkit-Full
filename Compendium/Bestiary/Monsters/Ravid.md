### Traits
***Positive Energy Lash.*** An undead creature that touches the ravid takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) radiant damage. This damage is already included in the ravid's melee attacks.

***Aura of Animation.*** At the start of the ravid's turn, a single randomly determined object of Huge size or smaller within 20 feet of the ravid comes to life as if animated by an animate objects spell. The ravid does not control these objects, but the objects act autonomously, defending the ravid to the best of their ability. The ravid can maintain concentration on up to three animated objects. When a new one is animated, the effect ends on a randomly determined object that was previously animated. When the ravid fails a concentration check, the effect ends on a single randomly determined animated object.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ravid makes two melee attacks: one with its tail and one with its claws.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is an undead creature, it takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) radiant damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d4+2}) slashing damage. If the target is an undead creature, it takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) radiant damage.
