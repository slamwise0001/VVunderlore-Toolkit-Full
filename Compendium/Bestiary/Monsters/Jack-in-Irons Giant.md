### Traits
***Pound.*** A jack-in-irons that grapples an opponent of Medium size or smaller can smash the opponent into the ground or any other nearby solid object as an attack. This attack hits automatically and does 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) bludgeoning damage and the creature must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of the giant's next turn.

***Shake the Earth.*** As an action, a jack-inirons can stomp its foot on the ground, causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature within 10 feet of the jack-in-irons must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A jack-inirons giant makes two melee attacks in any combination of club, chain, fist, and pound, or it makes two ranged attacks, or it shakes the earth (see above).

***Club.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 ({@dice 3d10+6}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Strength saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of the giant's next turn.

***Chain.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+6}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and restrained until the start of the giant's next turn.

***Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Rock.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, range 60 ft./240 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 ({@dice 3d10+6}) bludgeoning damage.
