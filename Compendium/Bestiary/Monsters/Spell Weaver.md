### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The spell weaver has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***See Invisibility.*** A spell weaver can see invisible creatures as if under the permanent effect of a see invisibility spell.

***Telepathic Seclusion.*** The spell weaver is all but immune to telepathy. Attempts to communicate with it or to to read its mind using telepathy (such as with a detect thoughts spell or similar magic) automatically fail. Any creature making such an attempt must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 ({@dice 4d10}) psychic damage from the mental feedback and be stunned for 1 round. Spell weavers can communicate with each other using their telepathy ability, but telepathy spells they cast still fail automatically and the casting spell weaver must save against the feedback.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The spell weaver makes three unarmed strike attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 bludgeoning damage.

***Spell Weaving.*** The spell weaver has 6 arms. It can use them to cast multiple spells at once. For each spell it must use a number of arms equal to that spell's level (it must use at least one arm per spell, even if it is a cantrip). The spell weaver can use this ability to cast multiple spells of level 1 or higher, it is not limited to one spell and one cantrip. If the spell weaver casts multiple spells that require concentration, it can still only choose one spell to concentrate on, all other concentration spells automatically fail.
