### Traits
***Improved Critical.*** The troodon zombie scores a critical hit with its bite on a roll of 19 or 20.

***Pack Tactics.*** The troodon zombie has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the troodon zombie’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d10+1}) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of the troodon zombie's next turn.
