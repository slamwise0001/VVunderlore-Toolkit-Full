### Traits
***Create Spawn.*** A creature killed by a mohrg rises two days later as a zombie under the mohrg's control (see Appendix B for appropriate zombie statistics).

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The mohrg makes three melee attacks: one with its tongue and two with its claws.

***Tongue.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends the mohrg has advantage on attack rolls against the target and can't use its claws against another target.
