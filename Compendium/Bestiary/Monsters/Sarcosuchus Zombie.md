### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Water Poisoner.*** Water within 20 feet of the sarcosuchus zombie is tainted with toxins. A creature that enters or starts its turn in that water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or it is poisoned until the start of its next turn.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sarcosuchus zombie can make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28 ({@dice 4d10+6}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the sarcosuchus zombie can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 3d8+6}) bludgeoning damage.If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
