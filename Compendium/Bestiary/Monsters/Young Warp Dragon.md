### Traits
***Dimensional Bite.*** The dragon does not need to breathe and is immune to the hazards of outer space. It can fly beyond a planet's atmosphere and travel between planets. Travelling between planets using Dimensional Travel requires {@dice 2d10} days of travel time. Riders it carries while travelling through space are also protected from the void of outer space. It can also shift to other planes at will. This functions as the plane shift spell, but doesn't require material components.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Alien Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage.
