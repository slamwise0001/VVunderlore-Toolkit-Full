### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sanguineous drinker makes two melee attacks with its claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the sanguineous drinker regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Blood Spray.*** The sanguineous drinker deals 5 damage to itself and sprays blood in a 10 foot radius around itself. The area becomes slippery and creatures in the area other than sanguineous drinkers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, when the blood spray is used. A creature that enters the sprayed area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The area remains slippery for 1 minute before the blood dries up.
