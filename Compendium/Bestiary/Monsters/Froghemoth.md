### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The froghemoth can breathe air and water.

***Shock Susceptibility.*** If the froghemoth takes lightning damage, it suffers several effects until the end of its next turn: its speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it can't use reactions or Multiattack, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The froghemoth makes two attacks with its tentacles. It can also use its tongue or bite.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ( 3d8+6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the froghemoth can't use this tentacle on another target. The froghemoth has four tentacles.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 ( 3d10+6) piercing damage, and the target is swallowed if it is a Medium or smaller creature. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the froghemoth, and takes 10 ( 3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the froghemoth's turns. The froghemoth's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the Froghemoth takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Froghemoth must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the froghemoth. If the froghemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Tongue.*** The Froghemoth targets one Medium or smaller creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the froghemoth, and the froghemoth can make a bite attack against it as a bonus action.
