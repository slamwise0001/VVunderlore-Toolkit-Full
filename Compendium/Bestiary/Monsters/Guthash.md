### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 ({@dice 1d6}) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
