### Traits
***Vorpal Bite.*** The mandibles of a slicer beetle are extremely sharp. It scores a critical hit if the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on its attack roll, the affected creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Failure indicates the slicer beetle severed one of the opponent's extremities (roll {@dice 1d8}: 1-4 = arm, 5-8 = leg; even = right, odd = left).

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage. If this attack scores a critical hit, see Vorpal Bite.
