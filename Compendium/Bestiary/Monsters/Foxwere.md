### Traits
***Charming Gaze.*** As a bonus action, a foxwere in fox or human form can target one living creature within 30 feet and line of sight with its charming gaze. If the targeted creature can see the foxwere, then the targeted creature must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for one hour. A creature that is capable of taking actions can, at the start of its turn, look away to avoid the foxweres gaze for one complete round. If it targets the foxwere while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target. Creatures that are blind, unconscious, or unable to see the foxwere for any other reason are immune to this attack.

***Shapechanger.*** The foxwere can change from its fox form or human form to its hybrid form as a bonus action. Changing from fox form directly to human form or vice versa takes an action. The foxwere is Small in fox form but Medium in human or hybrid form. In fox form, it is indistinguishable from a normal fox, but is noticeably larger than other foxes.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** In hybrid form, a foxwere bites once and attacks once with its shortsword. In human or fox form, it makes one melee attack and can also use its charming gaze.

***Bite (fox/hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage.

***Shortsword (human/hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) piercing damage.
