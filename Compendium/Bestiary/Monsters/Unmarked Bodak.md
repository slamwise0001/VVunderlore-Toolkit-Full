### Traits
***Death Gaze.*** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the bodak and the two of them can see each other, the bodak can force the creature to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, if the bodak isn't incapacitated, taking 10 ({@dice 3d6}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the bodak until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. A Medium humanoid creature that dies after being reduced to 0 hit points by this ability, transforms into an unmarked bodak within the next 24 hours. True bodaks are immune to this ability.

***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** A bodak that begins its turn in natural daylight, takes 5 radiant damage. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions
***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d4+1}) bludgeoning damage.
