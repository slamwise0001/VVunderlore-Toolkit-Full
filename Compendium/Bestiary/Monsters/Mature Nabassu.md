### Traits
***Feed.*** When the nabassu uses its multiattack to attack a single humanoid creature that is incapacitated, it tears chunks of flesh from the creature's body and consumes them. If this kills the humanoid, the nabassu regains 13 ({@dice 3d8}) hit points and gains advantage on attack rolls while it has more than its natural hit point maximum. The body of a humanoid slain by a nabassu's feed ability is too damaged to be revived with a revivify or raise dead spell.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Death—Stealing Gaze.*** If a humanoid creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the nabassu and the two of them can see each other, the nabassu can force the creature to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw if the nabassu isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 ({@dice 6d8}) necrotic damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the death—stealing gaze instantly dies and rises the next round as a ghoul that obeys the nabassu's commands. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throws at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the nabassu until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The nabassu deals an extra 7 ({@dice 2d6}) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the nabassu that isn't incapacitated and the nabassu doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nabassu makes three melee attacks: two with its claws and one with its bite.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) piercing damage.

***Focus Gaze.*** The nabassu concentrates its death—stealing gaze on a single humanoid creature. If the nabassu and the target can see each other, that creature must immediately make a saving throw against the nabassu's death—stealing gaze.
