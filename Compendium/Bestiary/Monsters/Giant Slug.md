### Traits
***Keen Smell.*** The slug has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Spider Climb.*** The slug can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The slug makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bite.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) piercing damage.
