### Traits
***Discorporation.*** When Tiamat drops to 0 hit points or dies, her body is destroyed but her essence travels back to her domain in the Nine Hells, and she is unable to take physical form for a time.

***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If Tiamat fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Limited Magic Immunity.*** Unless she wishes to be affected, Tiamat is immune to spells of 6th level or lower. She has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Tiamat's weapon attacks are magical.

***Multiple Heads.*** Tiamat can take one reaction per turn, rather than only one per round. She also has advantage on saving throws against being knocked unconscious. If she fails a saving throw against an effect that would stun a creature, one of her unspent legendary actions is spent.

***Regeneration.*** Tiamat regains 30 hit points at the start of her turn.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Tiamat can use her Frightful Presence. She then makes three attacks: two with her claws and one with her tail.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 ( 4d6+10) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +19 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. Hit: 28 ( 4d8+10) piercing damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Tiamat's choice that is within 240 feet of Tiamat and aware of her must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Tiamat's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.


### Legendary Actions
***Unknown Legendary Action.*** Tiamat's legendary action options are associated with her five dragon heads (a bite and a breath weapon for each). Once Tiamat chooses a legendary action option for one of her heads, she can't choose another one associated with that head until the start of her next turn.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 32 ( 4d10+10) slashing damage plus 14 ( 4d6) acid damage (black dragon head), lightning damage (blue dragon head), poison damage (green dragon head), fire damage (red dragon head), or cold damage (white dragon head).

***Black Dragon Head: Acid Breath (Costs 2 Actions).*** Tiamat breathes acid in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 67 ( 15d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Blue Dragon Head: Lightning Breath (Costs 2 Actions).*** Tiamat breathes lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 ( 16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Green Dragon Head: Poison Breath (Costs 2 Actions).*** Tiamat breathes poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 ( 22d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Red Dragon Head: Fire Breath (Costs 2 Actions).*** Tiamat breathes fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 ( 26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***White Dragon Head: Cold Breath (Costs 2 Actions).*** Tiamat breathes an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 ( 16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
