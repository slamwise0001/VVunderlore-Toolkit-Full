### Traits
***Acid Spray.*** Every time a draudnu takes piercing or slashing damage, all creatures within 5 feet of it take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage, or 7 ({@dice 2d6}) acid damage if the piercing or slashing damage is from a critical hit.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The draudnu makes three flesh hook attacks.

***Flesh Hook.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 3d6+4}) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained, as the draudnu pins it to the floor or the nearest wall or pillar, detaching its hook and immediately growing a new one. A creature can use its action to attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, to remove the hook from itself or another creature, ending the effect on that creature. Gutâ€”Churning Form (Recharge 6). Each creature within 30 feet of the draudnu that can see it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become poisoned and frightened for one minute as it has a feeling of something growing inside its body. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
