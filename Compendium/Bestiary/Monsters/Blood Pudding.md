### Traits
***Amorphous.*** A blood pudding can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty.

***Cold Vulnerability.*** A blood pudding that takes cold damage has its speed halved, it cant grapple (a grappled creature is immediately released), and damage from disgorgement is halved.

***Disgorgement.*** When a blood pudding starts its turn infused in a host creature (see Infusion), it uses its action to force out the creatures blood and bodily fluids through the creatures eyes, ears, nose, mouth, open wounds, and pores. The host creature takes 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) bludgeoning damage. If the creature dies, the blood pudding stays put, feeding on the corpse from the inside. When sated, the pudding oozes out; to onlookers, it appears as if the slain creature is bleeding profusely.

***Infusion.*** A blood pudding that starts its turn grappling a creature forces itself into that creatures body through osmosis. The blood pudding quickly disappears as it oozes into wounds and through skin. This is an action on the part of the blood pudding. It causes no damage to the target but does turn the hosts eyes blood red and gives it an overall swollen, flushed appearance. A creature infused with a blood pudding can use an action on its turn trying to eject the creature by coughing it up, vomiting, and so on. The blood pudding is expelled with a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Lesser restoration and comparable magic gives the host tactical advantage on its next Constitution saving throw to expel the pudding. Drinking alcohol has the same effect. If the host creature takes damage from an external cause (not from the blood pudding), the blood pudding takes half as much. It does not get saving throws against attacks that allow them, but simply takes half as much damage as the host creature. If a blood pudding is killed while inside a host creature, the creature is considered poisoned until greater restoration is cast on it. If the blood pudding is still infused in the creature at the start of the puddings turn, it disgorges (see Disgorge).

***Vinegar Vulnerability.*** Drinking vinegar forces an infused blood pudding to abandon a hosts body immediately. The host takes 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) bludgeoning damage from the pudding rapidly forcing itself out and must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for {@dice 1d4} rounds. The blood pudding is poisoned for {@dice 2d6} rounds.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage and a Medium or Large target is grappled and restrained (see Infusion above). A blood pudding can grapple one creature at a time.
