### Traits
***Blood Drain.*** Immediately after making a constriction attack against a grappled creature, the cave leech can try to drag that creature to its mouth, where it bites the creature automatically and drains its blood, inflicting 4 ({@dice 1d8}) piercing damage. The target can resist being dragged with a Strength contest against the cave leech; the cave leech must win the contest to drag the character to its mouth. A character who wins this contest does not break the cave leech's grapple. The cave leech can try a Strength contest against every creature it makes a constriction attack against until it wins a Strength contest and drains one creature's blood. It can drain blood from the same creature or a different creature each round, but it must win a Strength contest each time.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cave leech attacks eight times, in any combination of tentacle attacks and constriction attacks.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

***Constriction.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature grappled by a tentacle. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target can be dragged to the cave leech's mouth to be drained of blood (see above).
