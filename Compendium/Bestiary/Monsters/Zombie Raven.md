### Traits
***Disintegration.*** Zombie ravens disintegrate into dust and feathers when destroyed. Whenever five zombie ravens have been destroyed in a confined space (or 10 in the open), all living creatures involved in the fight must make successful DC 10 Constitution saving throws. The saving throw must be repeated every time another five (or 10 in the open) zombie ravens are destroyed. The first failed saving throw causes a creature to have tactical disadvantage on attack rolls against targets that are more than 5 feet away (if the attack is a spell that relies on a saving throw, the target has tactical advantage on the saving throw). The second failed saving throw applies tactical disadvantage to all attacks, regardless of range. The third failed saving throw blinds the creature. These penalties last until the affected creature leaves the confined space (or the area) where the fight occurred, or until five minutes have passed.

***Mobility.*** An opponent has tactical disadvantage on opportunity attacks against a flying zombie raven.

***Unholy Fortitude.*** Zombie ravens care nothing about the deities of humanoids, so they have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

### Actions
***Beak.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage.
