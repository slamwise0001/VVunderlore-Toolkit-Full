### Traits
***Trample.*** As the ascomoid moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies but can't stop there. Creatures in spaces the ascomoid enters can attempt DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, on a failed save, the creature takes 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet to get out of the ascomoid's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. An ascomoid can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d8+3}) bludgeoning damage.

***Spores (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: automatic hit (20 ft. radius sphere within 30 ft. range; creatures in sphere). Hit: creatures in the sphere must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw against poison or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage and become nauseated (incapacitated) for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A successful save negates the poison damage but not the incapacitated condition, and also makes the creature immune to further spore attacks from the same ascomoid for 24 hours.
