### Traits
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Planar Travel.*** The dragon can cast plane shift after spending one hour in uninterrupted meditation.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Mesmerizing Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Mesmerizing Presence.*** The dragon's glimmering scales create a hypnotic pattern. Each creature within 120 feet that can see the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature's speed is reduced to 0. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Mesmerizing Presence for the next 24 hours.
