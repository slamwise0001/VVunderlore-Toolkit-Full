### Traits
***Fungus Bat Poison.*** A creature that fails a DC 11 Consti saving throw against fungus bat poison suffers the usual effects of being poisoned. In addition, if the creature typically moves around on legs, it loses the use of its legs for {@dice 1d4} rounds. It falls prone immediately, and it can't stand up again until after the {@dice 1d4} rounds have elapsed. A successful saving throw against fungus bat poison does not impart any immunity against future poisonings.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of fungus bat poison (see above).
