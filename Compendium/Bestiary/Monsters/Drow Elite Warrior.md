### Traits
***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( 1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 ( 3d6) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack:  +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( 1d6+4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
