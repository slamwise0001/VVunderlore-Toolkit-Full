### Traits
***Regeneration.*** At the start of its turn, a gallows tree zombie regains 5 lost hit points. This ability fails to function if the creature has been severed from its gallows tree (see Tether Vine, above).

***Tether Vine.*** A gallows tree zombie is connected to the gallows tree that created it by a sinewy vine. This vine can be lengthened to allow the zombie to move up to 100 feet from the tree. The vine has AC 14 and 10 hit points. Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent the zombie from using its regeneration.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A gallows tree zombie attacks once with its fists and can create one spore cloud.

***Fists.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Spore Cloud (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 5 ft. cube adjacent to zombie, creatures in cube. Hit: a creature in the cloud of spores must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of a slow spell lasting 6 rounds (no concentration required). When the slow effect ends, the target takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw.
