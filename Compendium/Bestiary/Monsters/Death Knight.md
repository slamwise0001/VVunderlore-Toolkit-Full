### Traits
***Undead Nature.*** A death knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Magic Resistance.*** The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Marshal Undead.*** Unless the death knight is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( 1d8+5) slashing damage, or 10 ( 1d10+5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 ( 4d8) necrotic damage.

***Hellfire Orb (1/Day).*** The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 ( 10d6) fire damage and 35 ( 10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
