### Traits
***Deadly Critical.*** Dagon scores a critical hit whenever its attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. A creature struck by a critical hit from Dagon is also poisoned for one minute and must make a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw or immediately begin drowning. This affects all creatures, even those that can ordinarily breathe underwater or are benefiting from a water breathing spell or similar magic. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; drowning ceases with a successful save. Drowning continues until a successful save is made, the target dies, or the effect is dispelled as a 7th-level spell. A successful saving throw does not make the target immune to this effect from another critical hit.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** Dagon can opt to automatically succeed on a saving throw it just failed.
