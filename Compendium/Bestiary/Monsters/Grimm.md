### Traits
***Aura of Evil.*** A grimm constantly exudes a miasma of evil around itself. Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a grimm takes {@dice 2d6} radiant damage. Creatures of evil alignment are immune to this effect.

***Diehard.*** A grimm does not die when it reaches 0 hit points. Instead, the creature continues fighting, but it must make a Constitution saving throw every time it takes damage while at 0 hit points. The DC of the saving throw equals the damage from the attack. The first time the grimm fails this saving throw, it gains tactical disadvantage on all its attack rolls and ability checks, but it keeps fighting. When it fails this saving throw for a second time, it dies instantly.

***Devour.*** If both of a grimm's claw attacks and its bite attack hit the same target in a single turn, the grimm gains temporary hit points equal to the piercing damage done by its bite.

***Ethereal Jaunt (Recharge 5—6).*** A grimm can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a bonus action when it moves. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane only until ethereal jaunt recharges; it must return to the Material Plane on the first turn it can (but not necessarily as the first thing it does that turn; the grimm could move in the Ethereal Plane before returning to the Material Plane). While in the Ethereal Plane, the grimm can't be seen or harmed by anyone on the Material Plane except by magical effects that cross the planar boundary. It can see and hear what is around it (within 60 feet) on the Material Plane, but it can't harm anything in the Material Plane. While Ethereal, the grimm can move in any direction, even up or down and through solid objects, but it treats all space as difficult terrain.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A grimm attacks twice with its claws, then bites once.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the grimm gains tactical advantage on its bite attack if it makes that attack immediately against the same target.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage. Also see devour, above.

***Ethereal Jaunt (Recharge 5—6).*** See entry in traits.
