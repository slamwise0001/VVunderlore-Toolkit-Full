### Traits
***Shapechange.*** The dryad can use her action to change its shape to appear as a beautiful female elf. Her statistics don't change, except that she can't use her Thorny Body ability and claw attacks in this form. She can change back to her natural briar form at will, using another action.

***Magic Resistance.*** The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Speak with Beasts and Plants.*** The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one living briar within her reach and emerge from a second living briar within 60 feet of the first briar, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second briar. Both briars must be Large or bigger.

***Thorny Body (Briar Form Only).*** A creature that touches the dryad takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) piercing damage.

### Actions
***Claws (Briar Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) slashing damage.

***Briar Cage.*** The dryad magically encases a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet in sharp briars. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) piercing damage and be restrained. As an action, a creature may attempt a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check to free itself of the briars. Doing so causes the creature to take an additional 9 ({@dice 2d8}) piercing damage. The briars can also be destroyed by attacking them. They have AC 10, 10 hit points and resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage.
