### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The eel hound can breathe air and water.

***Pack Tactics.*** The eel hound has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the hound's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Slick Spittle.*** By spending 2 rounds dribbling spittle on an area, an eel hound can cover a 5-foot square with its slippery saliva. This area is treated as if under the effects of a grease spell, but it lasts for 1 hour.

***Slithering Bite.*** When an eel hound moves adjacent to an enemy and makes a bite attack, it may immediately move up to 5 feet, as long as it stays within 5 feet of the enemy it attacked. If another eel hound already occupies that space, the moving eel hound can keep moving until it reaches an empty space that's still adjacent to that same enemy.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
