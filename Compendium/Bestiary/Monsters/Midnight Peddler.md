### Traits
***Divination.*** The peddler provides good advice or a correct answer to one question asked of him by a creature who buys something from his cart. This ability functions similarly to a divination spell.

***Plane Shift.*** The midnight peddler can use the plane shift spell at will. He can shift only himself, his cart, and the nonliving contents of his cart; he can't bring along willing companions or banish other creatures.

### Actions
***Deathly Touch.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d6+1}) necrotic damage. The target's maximum number of hit points is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage, and the midnight peddler gains the same number of temporary hit points.
