### Traits
***Pounce.*** If the deinonychus zombie moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the deinonychus zombie can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Undying Hunger (1/Turn).*** If the deinonychus zombie hits a creature with a claw attack, the deinonychus zombie gains 5 temporary hit points.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The deinonychus zombie makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) slashing damage.
