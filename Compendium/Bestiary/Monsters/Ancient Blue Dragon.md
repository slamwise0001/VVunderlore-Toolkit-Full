### Traits
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. 

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage. 

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage. 

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. 

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. 

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales lightning in a 120-­-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. 

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack. 

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
