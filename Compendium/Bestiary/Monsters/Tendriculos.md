### Traits
***Camouflage.*** Until it attacks or is set afire, a tendriculos is indistinguishable from a normal haystack.

***Swallow.*** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the tendriculoss turns. One Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the tendriculos at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the tendriculos or by attacks from outside it, with one exception; if the tendriculos takes fire damage, creatures inside it take half as much fire damage. A swallowed creature can get out of the tendriculos by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the tendriculos is dead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A tendriculos attacks twice with tendrils and makes one swallow attack, if it can. Having creatures grappled doesnt reduce the tendriculoss number of tendril attacks.

***Tendril.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. A creature grappled by more than one tendril is also restrained.

***Swallow.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the tendriculos at the start of the tendriculoss turn. Hit: the grappled creature is dragged to the tendriculoss mouth and swallowed (see Swallow, above).
