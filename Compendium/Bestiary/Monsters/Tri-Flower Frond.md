### Traits
***Camouflage.*** A tri-flower frond looks like a normal, if exotic, flowering plant. Until it attacks, its dangerous nature can be recognized only with close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. Once characters have fought these plants, they can be recognized again on sight.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A tri-flower frond makes two melee attacks.

***Tranquilizing Tendrils.*** Melee Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become unconscious. This is a poison effect; resistance or immunity to sleep effects dont apply against it. The creature remains unconscious for one hour or until wakened with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

***Digestive Juice.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one unconscious creature. Hit: 3 ( 1d6) acid damage.

***Fluid Drain.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one unconscious creature. Hit: the target is grappled and its Constitution score is reduced by  1d3 points. A creature dies if its Constitution is reduced to 0.
