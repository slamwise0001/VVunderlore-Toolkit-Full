### Traits
***Keen Senses.*** Hyaenodons have tactical advantage on Perception checks based on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** A hyaenodon has tactical advantage on its attack roll if the target is already grappled by at least one other hyaenodon.

***Scrapping for Food.*** A creature that is grappled by one or more hyaenodons takes damage automatically at the start of its turn. It takes 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage from the first grappling hyaenodon, 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) from the second hyaenodon, 14 ({@dice 3d6+4}) from the third hyaenodon, and so on. Up to four hyaenodons can grapple the same Small or Medium creature. Up to six can grapple a Large creature.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled; see Scrapping for Food, above. A hyaenodon can't bite while it has a target grappled.
