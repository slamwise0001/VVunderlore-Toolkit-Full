***Soothing Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the calm emotions spell (both effects) for 1 minute. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect is dispelled, or the dragon attacks, the effect ends and the creature is immune to the dragon's Soothing Presence for the next 24 hours.
