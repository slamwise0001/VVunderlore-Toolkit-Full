### Traits
***Pack Tactics.*** The beggar ghoul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one other allied beggar ghoul is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Savage Hunger.*** A beggar ghoul that hits with its bite attack against a creature that hasn't acted yet in this combat scores a critical hit.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
