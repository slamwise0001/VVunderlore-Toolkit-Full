### Traits
***Armor-Piercing Bite.*** The bony ridges that a leucrotta has for teeth can chew through metal or wood. When a leucrotta scores a critical hit with its bite attack, the target's armor or shield (GM's choice), if any, loses one point of armor protection; e.g., a damaged shield provides just one point of AC instead of two, or a chain shirt provides AC 12 + Dex mod instead of AC 13 + Dex mod. This damage is cumulative, but it can be repaired by an armorer for 20% of the armor or shield's new cost per critical hit inflicted on it. Magical properties continue to function while the armor or shield is damaged.

***Kicking Retreat.*** When a leucrotta turns to flee, it instinctively kicks with both rear legs as a bonus action before racing away. The leucrotta still provokes an opportunity attack when it leaves a character's reach.

***Mimic Voice.*** A leucrotta can mimic the voice of a man, woman, child, or a domestic animal in pain. This is often used to lure a victim into attack range. To mimic a voice, the leucrotta must make a Charisma (Deception) check opposed by the passive Wisdom (Perception) of any listeners. Characters who expressly try to determine whether the sound is mimicry can make an active Wisdom (Perception) check instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A leucrotta bites once and kicks once.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage.

***Kick.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature behind the leucrotta. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) bludgeoning damage and the target is knocked prone.
