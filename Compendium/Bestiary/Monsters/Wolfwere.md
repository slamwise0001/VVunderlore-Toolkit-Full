### Traits
***Mesmerizing Gaze.*** As a bonus action, a wolfwere in wolf or human form can target one living creature within 30 feet and line of sight with its mesmerizing gaze. If the targeted creature can see the wolfwere, then the targeted creature must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A creature that is capable of taking actions can, at the start of its turn, look away to avoid the wolfweres gaze for one complete round. If it targets the wolfwere while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target. Creatures that are blind, unconscious, or unable to see the wolfwere for any other reason are immune to this attack.

***Shapechanger.*** The wolfwere can change from its wolf form or human form to its hybrid form as a bonus action. Changing from wolf form directly to human form or vice versa takes an action. In wolf form, it is indistinguishable from a normal wolf.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** In hybrid form, a wolfwere makes two melee attacks, one of which can be with its scimitar. In human or fox form, it makes one melee attack and can also use its mesmerizing gaze.

***Bite (wolf form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 2d4+3}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Claws (hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) slashing damage.

***Scimitar (human/hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) slashing damage.
