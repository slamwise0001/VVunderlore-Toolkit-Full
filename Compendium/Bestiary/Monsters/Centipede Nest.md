### Traits
***Centipede Poison.*** The first time a character takes damage from a centipede nest, the character must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the character is immune to the poison from that swarm. On a failed save, the character becomes paralyzed. A paralyzed character repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a successful save, the paralysis ends and the character becomes poisoned instead. The character remains poisoned for 5 minutes.

***Swarm.*** The swarming nest can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. The swarm can move through an opening large enough for an individual Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. Once a character takes damage from a centipede nest, the centipedes are on him or her, and the character continues taking 1 piercing damage every round at the start of the centipede nest's turn, even if the character moves away from the swarm. This continues until three actions have been spent smashing, sweeping, and plucking off all the centipedes that crawled onto the character.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 0 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target might suffer the effect of Centipede Poison; see above.
