### Traits
***Boggoul Bile.*** The boggoul excretes a bilious fluid from its pores. The boggoul chooses whether the bile is noxious or paralyzing. It can change the property of its bile from one to another as a bonus action. Noxious Bile: A creature other than an undead, that touches the boggoul takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) necrotic damage. Paralyzing Bile: A creature other than an elf or undead, that touches the boggoul must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Dimensional Rift.*** As a bonus action, the boggoul can create an invisible and immobile rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the boggoul can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "30 feet straight up"). While next to the rift, the boggoul can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggoul puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the boggoul can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the boggoul's next turn.

### Actions
***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d4+4}) slashing damage. If the boggoul is covered in noxious bile, and the target is a creature other than an undead, it takes an additional 4 ({@dice 1d8}) necrotic damage. If the boggoul is covered in paralyzing bile, and the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Bile Puddle.*** The boggoul creates a puddle of bile that is either noxious or paralyzing (boggoul's choice). The puddle is 1 inch deep and covers the ground in the boggoul's space. The puddle lasts 1 hour. If the bile is noxious, any creature other than an undead, that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) necrotic damage. If the bile is paralyzing, any creature other than an elf or undead, that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures wearing footwear that is completely waterproof automatically succeed on saving throws against the bile puddle unless its depth reaches past the footwear.
