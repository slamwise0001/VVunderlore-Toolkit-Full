### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Siege Monster.*** The dragon deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d10+7}) piercing damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) cold damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d6+7}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d8+7}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Tidal Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The dragon exhales a crushing wave of frigid seawater in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 33 ({@dice 6d10}) bludgeoning damage and 33 ({@dice 6d10}) cold damage, and is pushed 30 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a successful save the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

### Legendary Actions
***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 ({@dice 2d6+7}) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then move up to half its flying speed, or half its swim speed if in the water.
