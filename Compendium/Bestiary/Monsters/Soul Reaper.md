### Traits
***Aura of Evil.*** A soul reaper constantly exudes a miasma of evil around itself. Any creature that begins its turn within 15 feet of a soul reaper takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage. Creatures of evil alignment are immune to this effect.

***Inseparable Weapon.*** If separated from its scythe, the soul reaper can summon the weapon back into its hands as a bonus action. If someone else is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent and the soul reaper engage in a contest pitting the opponents Strength (Athletics) against the soul reapers Charisma (Intimidation). If the soul reaper wins the contest, the scythe returns to its hands and the opponent takes damage as if struck by the scythe. If the opponent wins the contest, it takes 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage.

***Soul Slash.*** If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its soul is torn from its body and into the soul reapers scythe, and the creature dies immediately. A victims soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk and crumbles to dust after 24 hours. To release a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all trapped souls are released. If a souls body hasnt crumbled into dust, the soul returns to the body and the body returns to life. Souls without a body are left to wander formlessly, but they can be returned to life through powerful magic (wish, true resurrection).

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A soul reaper attacks three times with its scythe.

***Scythe +1.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) necrotic damage. If this attack hits a creature with 0 hit points, the target dies instantly. The scythe scores a critical hit if the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. A critical hit causes an additional 4 ({@dice 1d8}) slashing damage and 5 ({@dice 1d10}) necrotic damage, and see Soul Slash above.
