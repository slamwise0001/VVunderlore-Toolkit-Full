### Traits
***Ethereal Sight.*** The spectral steed can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The spectral steed can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Soul Charge (1/Day).*** If the spectral steed moves at least 20 feet in a straight line through at least one other creature, one creature of the spectral steed's choice that it moved through must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The target takes 28 ({@dice 8d6}) cold damage and has its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest on a failed saving throw, or takes half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, it dies.

***Sunlight Powerlessness.*** While in natural sunlight, the spectral steed is completely powerless and cannot use its soul charge ability or take actions other than Dodge and Dash.

### Actions
***Hoof Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d6}) cold damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, until it finishes a long rest. If the creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, it dies.
