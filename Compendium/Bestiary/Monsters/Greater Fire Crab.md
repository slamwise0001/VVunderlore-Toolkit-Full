### Traits
***Ring of Fire.*** The body of a greater fire crab generates intense heat. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a greater fire crab takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage. This damage is cumulative if more than one fire crab is within 5 feet of the character.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A greater fire crab attacks twice, in any combination of pincer and crush attacks.

***Pincer.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) slashing damage plus 2 ({@dice 1d4}) fire damage and the target is grappled.

***Crush.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled at the start of the fire crab's turn. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) slashing damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) fire damage and the target is grappled.
