### Traits
***Swallow.*** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) bludgeoning damage automatically at the start of each of the hieroglyphicroc's turns. Only one Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the hieroglyphicroc at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the hieroglyphicroc or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the hieroglyphicroc by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the hieroglyphicroc is destroyed. A humanoid that dies inside a hieroglyphicroc reanimates as a zombie {@dice 1d4} rounds later, and is regurgitated by the hieroglyphicroc.

***Unholy Fortitude.*** Hieroglyphicrocs are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d10+3}) piercing damage. If the attack causes 16 or more damage to a Medium or smaller creature, the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the hieroglyphicroc (see above).
