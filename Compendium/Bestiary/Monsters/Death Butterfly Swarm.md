| 1 | 13 | 10 | 1 | 12 | 15 |

**Armor Class**: 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points**: 60

**Speed**: walk 5, fly {'number': 40, 'condition': ' (hover)'}

**Senses**: darkvision 60 ft.

**Challenge**: 4

### Traits
***Potent Poison.*** The death butterfly swarm's poison affects corporeal undead who are otherwise immune to poison.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit point.

***Weight of Wings.*** A creature in a space occupied by the death butterfly swarm has its speed reduced by half, and must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature doesn't share a space with the swarm at the end of the creature's turn. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to the swarm's blindness (but not the speed reduction) for 24 hours.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes a Bite attack against every target in its spaces.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 0 ft., every target in the swarm's space. Hit: 22 ({@dice 6d6+1}) piercing damage, or 11 ({@dice 3d6+1}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target also takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage and becomes poisoned for {@dice 1d4} rounds; a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw reduces poison damage by half and prevents the poisoned condition.
