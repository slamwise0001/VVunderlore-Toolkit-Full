### Traits
***Magic Attacks.*** The ysolith's weapon attacks are magical.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ysolith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spider Climb.*** The obyrith can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ysolith makes five attacks: three with its stings and two with its tentacles.

***Stings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6} psychic) damage and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 4d6+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Horrifying Form (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the ysolith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened and taking 36 ({@dice 8d8}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one as horror takes it over. While frightened, the creature is stunned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
