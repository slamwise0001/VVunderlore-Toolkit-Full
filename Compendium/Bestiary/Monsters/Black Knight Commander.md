### Traits
***Charge.*** If the black knight commander is mounted and moves at least 30 feet in a straight line toward a target and then hits it with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 10 ({@dice 3d6}) damage.

***Hateful Aura.*** The black knight commander and allies within 10 feet of the commander add its Charisma modifier to weapon damage rolls (included in damage below).

***Magic Weapons.*** The black knight commander's weapon attacks are made with magical (+1) weapons.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The black knight commander makes two melee attacks.

***Mace.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d6+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Lance.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d12+5}) piercing damage.

***Frightful Charge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The black knight commander lets loose a terrifying cry and makes one melee attack at the end of a charge. Whether the attack hits or misses, all enemies within 15 feet of the target and aware of the black knight commander's presence must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
