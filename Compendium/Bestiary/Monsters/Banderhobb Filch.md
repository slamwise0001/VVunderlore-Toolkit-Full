### Traits
***Drag away.*** The banderhobb may move its full speed and even take Dash actions while grappling a creature.

***Distracting Frenzy (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the banderhobb uses its multiattack to only attack one creature, allies within 5 feet ot the target may immediately use their reaction to make a single melee attack against the target.

***Resonant Connection.*** If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object within 1 mile of the banderhobb.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The banderhobb makes two claw attacks.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) slashing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the banderhobb can't use its claw attack on another target.

***Sack.*** The banderhobb pulls the sack it is carrying over a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. The banderhobb makes a Strength (Athletics) check, opposed by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. If the banderhobb succeeds, the target is restrained in addition to being grappled. The target cannot end the grapple while restrained. It may attempt to end the restrained condition by destroying the sack. The sack has an armor class of 5, 10 hit points, resistance to piercing damage and immunity to bludgeoning damage.

***Shadow Step.*** The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see. Before or after teleporting, it can make a Multiattack action or stinking gob attack.

***Stinking Gob.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 3d8}) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.
