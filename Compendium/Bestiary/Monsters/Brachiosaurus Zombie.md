### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Stomp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 34 ({@dice 5d10+7}) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 40 ({@dice 6d10+7}) bludgeoning damage.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The brachiosaurus zombie exhales poison gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 ({@dice 10d8}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
