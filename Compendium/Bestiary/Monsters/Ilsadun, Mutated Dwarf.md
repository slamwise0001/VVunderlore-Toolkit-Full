### Traits
***Drink Blood.*** If Ilsadun hits the same creature with two greatclub attacks on the same turn, she can use a bonus action to have the eel tentacles on her face drain the targetâ€™s blood. This reduces the maximum hits points of the creature by 4. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Ilsadun makes two greatclub attacks.

***Greatclub.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frantic Surge (1/Day).*** Ilsadun makes two greatclub attacks against each adjacent creature. Until the start of her next turn, all melee attacks against Ilsadun are made with advantage.
