### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Planar Travel.*** The dragon can cast plane shift without material components after spending one hour in uninterrupted meditation.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d10+7}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d6+7}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d8+7}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
