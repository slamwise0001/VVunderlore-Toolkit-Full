### Traits
***Animate Plants (1/Day).*** As an action, a shroom can magically animate plants within 50 feet of itself. The effect is identical to the animate objects spell, but only live plants can be animated and the duration is 24 hours.

***Awaken Plants (1/Month).*** A shroom can magically awaken one plant it touches. The effect is identical to the awaken spell, but only live plants can be awakened.

***Toxic Flesh.*** Any creature that tastes the flesh of a shroom must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature detects the poison and spits out the morsel before any damage is done. If the save fails, the character is overwhelmed by the deliciousness of the shroom and immediately downs a mouthful, then continues eating in a normal manner until full or until someone stops him or her. An hour after consuming even one bite of shroom flesh, the eater is affected as if by a feeblemind spell. The effect of the toxin can actually turn out to be beneficial in the long run; there is a 5 percent chance that a character who recovers or is restored to sanity after being feebleminded by shroom flesh permanently gains 1 point of Intelligence from the experience. A character can gain this benefit only once.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Psychic Thrashing.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 100 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) psychic damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
