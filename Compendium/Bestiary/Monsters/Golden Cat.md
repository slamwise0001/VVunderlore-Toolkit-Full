### Traits
***Escape Artist (1/Day).*** The golden cat teleports up to 30 feet as a move.

***Luck/Unluck (3/Day).*** The owner of a golden cat can reroll one die and take the most favorable result, provided the golden cat is within 40 feet of its owner. Only one reroll is allowed per round. This ability is a power of the cat, which responds to its owner's telepathic request for luck. There is a downside, however. Each time the golden cat grants luck (a reroll) to its owner, it saps a bit of luck from other, nearby creatures. All other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat have tactical disadvantage on their first attack roll or ability check for one round.
