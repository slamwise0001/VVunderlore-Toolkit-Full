### Traits
***Entangle.*** The hanged man's noose is a 20-foot length of rope that moves on its own like an animated object to entangle opponents of any size. An entangled creature is grappled and restrained. If it is not already adjacent to the hanged man, the rope initiates a Strength contest against the entangled creature on each of the hanged man's turns. If the rope wins the contest, it pulls the entangled creature 10 feet closer to the hanged man. If the entangled creature wins the Str contest, it stays at its current range from the hanged man. Only one creature can be entangled at a time. The rope can be attacked directly (AC 13); it is destroyed by 15 points of slashing or fire damage but is immune to all other damage. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The rope becomes nothing more than 20 feet of rotted rope if removed from the hanged man.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A hanged man attacks once with claws and once with its rope.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) slashing damage.

***Rope.*** Ranged Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, range 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 ({@dice 1d4+1}) necrotic damage and the target is entangled (see above).
