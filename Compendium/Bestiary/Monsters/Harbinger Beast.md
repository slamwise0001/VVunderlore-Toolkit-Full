### Traits
***Aura of Tragedy.*** A creature that fails a death saving throw within 25 feet of the harbinger beast, must remove one success from its previous death saving throws if it has any and gains disadvantage on its next death saving throw.

***Fateful Call.*** As a bonus action, the harbinger beast magically calls a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for one round. While charmed, the creature must use its full speed to move toward the harbinger beast as directly as possible. It can only move around obstacles if it can't enter the obstacle's space.

### Actions
***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 23 ({@dice 4d8+5}) piercing damage.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The harbinger beast exhales a poisonous gas in a 30 foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for 1 hour and taking 58 ({@dice 17d6}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
