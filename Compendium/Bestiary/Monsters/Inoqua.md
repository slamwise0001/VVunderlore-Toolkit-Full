### Traits
***Abyssal Essence.*** When the inoqua is damaged, a thick, stringy, black ichor made from the essence of the deep Abyss flows from the wounds in response. Any creature that deals damage to the obyrith with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or take 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn.

***Formless.*** The obyrith can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Magic Resistance.*** The inoqua has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Attacks.*** The inoqua's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The inoqua makes three tentacle attacks.

***Consumption.*** The inoqua makes one bite attack each against every Large or smaller creature it is grappling. On a hit, the target is swallowed. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the inoqua, and it takes 28 ({@dice 8d6}) psychic damage at the start of each of the inoqua's turns. If the inoqua takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the inoqua must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or expel all creatures stuffed in its folds, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the inoqua. If the inoqua dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. A creature that dies while swallowed by the inoqua transforms and immediately emerges to serve its new master as an isaati (it loses all previous memories, and its statistics are replaced with those of the obyrith).

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +18} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 37 ({@dice 6d8+10}) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +18} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 24 ({@dice 4d6+10}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). The inoqua can grapple up to five creatures. Mindâ€”Rending Form (Recharge 6). Each creature within 30 feet of the inoqua that can see it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, taking 54 ({@dice 12d8}) psychic damage, gaining disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma checks and saving throws and being blinded for one minute on a failed saving throw or taking half as much damage on a successful one as its mind is being torn asunder. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.

### Legendary Actions
***Magic Barrage.*** The inoqua casts its magic missile spell.

***Lash Out.*** The inoqua makes a bite or tentacle attack.

***Devour.*** The inoqua uses its consumption against a single target it is grappling.

***Entropic Rush (Costs 2 Actions).*** The inoqua moves up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Any creature in a space it moves through must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 ({@dice 2d8+10}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
