### Traits
***Dimensional Bite.*** The dragon can strike through a rift in space. When using an attack or multiattack action, it may attack any creature it can see within 120 ft. with its bite, independently of the bite's actual reach.

***Dimensional Travel.*** The dragon does not need to breathe and is immune to the hazards of outer space. It can fly beyond a planet's atmosphere and travel between planets. Travelling between planets using Dimensional Travel requires {@dice 2d10} days of travel time. Riders it carries while travelling through space are also protected from the void of outer space. It can also shift to other planes at will. This functions as the plane shift spell, but doesn't require material components.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Alien Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 2d10+9}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +16} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d6+9}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +16} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d8+9}) bludgeoning damage.

***Spiralling Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or gain disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute. While under this effect, attacks against these creatures have advantage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Alien Presence for the next 24 hours.
