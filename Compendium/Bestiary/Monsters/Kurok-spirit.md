### Traits
***Ghost Flames.*** Every creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of a kurok-spirit must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 2 ({@dice 1d4}) necrotic damage. The creature's maximum number of hit points is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage, and the kurok-spirit gains the same number of temporary hit points.

***Incorporeal.*** A kurok-spirit can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The kurok-spirit takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

***Soul Eater.*** A creature slain by a kurok-spirit can't be raised from the dead; its soul was devoured by the kurok-spirit and no longer exists.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d8}) necrotic damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) psychic damage.
