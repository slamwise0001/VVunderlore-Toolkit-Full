### Traits
***Control Elemental.*** Lava weirds have the ability to dominate elementals of the earth or fire type. When the lava weird uses an action to issue a command to an elemental within 50 feet, the elemental must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dominated. The effect is permanent, but the elemental is allowed to repeat the saving throw if it is commanded to do something that will clearly result in its own destruction. An elemental that makes a successful save is not dominated and is immune to this effect for 24 hours. Theres no limit to the number of elementals a lava weird can control. Once domination is established, it has no range limitation, provided the lava weird and the elemental remain on the same plane of existence. Lava weirds are immune to this effect.

***Lava Pool.*** A creature thats dragged into a lava pool (or that falls in, or winds up in lava for any reason at all) is restrained and takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. To escape from the lava, the creature or an adjacent ally must use an action and make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the creature moves 5 feet out of the lava pool, is prone, and is on fire. While on fire, the creature takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The fire is extinguished automatically when the creature or an adjacent ally spends an action to put it out.

***Reform.*** When reduced to 0 hit points, a lava weird dissolves into its lava pool. One minute later, it reforms with full hit points minus any hit points it lost to cold damage in the preceding 24 hours.

***Camouflage.*** Until it attacks, a lava weird in its lava pool is treated as invisible.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) fire damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. A grappled creature takes 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) fire damage at the start of its turn. If the save succeeds, the target is not grappled but it does catch fire if it is wearing or carrying combustible material or is itself flammable. While the fire burns, the creature takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The fire is extinguished automatically when the creature or an adjacent ally spends an action to put it out.

***Drag Into Lava.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature grappled by the lava weird. Hit: the lava weird and the grappled creature engage in a Strength (Athletics) contest. If the lava weird wins, the grappled creature is dragged into the lava pool; see Lava Pool above.
