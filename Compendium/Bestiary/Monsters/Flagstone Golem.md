### Traits
***Camouflage.*** While lying flat on the ground, a flagstone golem can't be distinguished from normal floor.

***Energy Absorption.*** If a flagstone golem is hit by an attack that causes damage of a type it is immune to, it takes no damage but instead heals 1 hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. Excess hit points are gained as temporary hit points.

***Energy Burst.*** As an action, a flagstone golem can "release" temporary hit points as a blast of energy. All creatures within 20 feet of the flagstone golem take force damage equal to the number of temporary hit points being released, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. This attack expels all of the flagstone golem's temporary hit points.

***Flatten.*** As an action, a flagstone golem can flatten itself onto the ground and become indistinguishable from normal flagstone flooring or any other flat, stone surface. While flattened, the golem becomes immune to all the damage types it is normally resistant to. Resuming humanoid shape takes another action.

***Magic Resistance.*** A flagstone golem has tactical advantage on saving throws versus spells and magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A flagstone golem attacks twice with fists.

***Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) bludgeoning damage. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the start of the flagstone golem's next turn.
