### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. Hit: The target takes 55 ({@dice 10d10}) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 ({@dice 4d8+4}) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
