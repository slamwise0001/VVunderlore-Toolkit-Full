***Opening Strike (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the scaled stalker hits a creature with a melee attack, one ally of its choice may immediately make a single melee attack against that target as a reaction.

***Tyrannical Leader.*** If a scaled stalker within 60 feet of the bandleader that can see the bandleader fails a saving throw against an effect that would frighten it, the bandleader can make a 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check against that stalker as a reaction.
