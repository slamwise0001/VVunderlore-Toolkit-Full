### Traits
***Flicker.*** Roll {@dice 1d6} for every amphoron in play at the start of its turn. On a roll of 1, the amphoron "flickers" due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. Flickering lasts until the start of the amphoron's next turn. While flickering, the amphoron can't be attacked and can't inflict damage. It regains 2 hit points when it rematerializes. A controller flickers only on a roll of 1 on {@dice 1d20}, but if it does, all amphorons under its control also flicker.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The amphoron attacks once with pincers and once with its flamethrower.

***Pincers.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+2}) piercing damage.

***Flamethrower.*** Area Weapon Attack: automatic hit range 100 ft. line, all creatures in line. Hit: creatures in the line must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage.
