### Traits
***Turn Resistance.*** The topi has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions
***Venomous Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) slashing damage plus 2 ( 1d4) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of the target's next turn.
