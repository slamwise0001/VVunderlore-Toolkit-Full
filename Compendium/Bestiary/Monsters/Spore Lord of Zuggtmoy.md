### Traits
***Spore Flight.*** If the spore lord is not incapacitated, it can transform into a spore cloud at the start of its move. While in this form, the spore lord gains a 40-foot fly speed, immunity to the charmed, frightened , paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained and stunned conditions (if it was subject to any of these conditions, the condition immediately ends), can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the spore lord can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny spore. The spore lord can't regain hit points, gain temporary hit points or use any action other than dash or dodge while in this form. It may assume its normal form at the start or end of its move on the same or any following turn. If the spore lord shares its space with another creature while in this form, that creature must immediately make a Save against the spore lord's spore cloud ability.

### Actions
***Burrowing Spores.*** The spore lord's spore bore into a creature within 5 feet or the spore lord. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned the creature takes 13 ({@dice 3d8}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns the creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Spore Cloud.*** The spore lord releases a lasting cloud of poisonous spores. The cloud fills a 10-foot radius sphere centered centered on the spore lord. The cloud stays there until the end of the spore lord's next turn. Any creature moving into or ending its turn inside the spore cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution save or take 18 ({@dice 4d8}) poison damage and become poisoned for one round.
