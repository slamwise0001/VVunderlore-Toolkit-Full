### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The dau has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack..*** The dau makes two slam attacks

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 10 ({@dice 3d6}) necrotic damage, and the dau regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

***Tangible Illusion (1/Day).*** After casting an illusion spell of an object, the dau temporarily transforms that illusion into a physical, nonmagical object. The temporary object lasts 10 minutes, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion expires). During that time, the illusion has all the physical properties of the object it represents, but not magical properties. The dau must touch the illusion to trigger this transformation, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet.
