### Traits
***Paralyzing Poison.*** Every time a character is clawed by a feral undead cat, he or she must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw. On the first failed save, the character becomes poisoned; on the second failed save, the character becomes restrained; and on the third failed save, the character becomes paralyzed. Each effect lasts for {@dice 1d6} x 10 minutes, and the lengths add together as the character's condition worsens.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The feral cat attacks twice with claws.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 slashing damage and the target creature must make a successful DC 8 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of paralyzing poison (see above).
