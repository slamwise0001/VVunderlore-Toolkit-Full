***Spellcasting.*** The lich is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). The lich has the following wizard spells prepared: 

Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost 

1st level (4 slots): detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave

***Turn Resistance.*** The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions
***Paralyzing Touch.*** Melee Spell Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Legendary Actions
The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. 

***Cantrip.*** The lich casts a cantrip. 

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch. 

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours. 

***Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each living creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
