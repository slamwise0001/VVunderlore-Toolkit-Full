### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A deep hunter attacks once with its tail and either bites or uses its swallow attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d12+5}) piercing damage plus 11 ({@dice 2d10}) poison damage, and the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained. If the target of this attack is already grappled by the sea serpent, the attack hits automatically but the target repeats the saving throw; if the save succeeds, the target escapes from the grapple and restraint, but if the save fails, the target is swallowed (see above). A deep hunter can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.

***Swallow (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the deep hunter. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 18 ({@dice 2d12+5}) piercing damage immediately, and another 13 ({@dice 3d8}) bludgeoning damage plus {@dice 2d8} acid damage automatically at the start of each of the sea serpents turns. Up to two Large creatures and any number of smaller creatures can be inside the deep hunter at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the deep hunter or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the deep hunter by using 15 feet of movement, but only after the sea serpent is dead.

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 10 feet away from the sea serpent.

***Coiling Maneuver.*** {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the sea serpent. A deep hunter can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.

***Unhinge Jaw.*** The sea serpent can try to recharge its swallow attack. Roll {@dice 1d6}; the attack recharges on a roll of 5 or 6.

***Tail Attack.*** The sea serpent uses its tail attack against a target within reach.
