### Traits
***Detect Invisibility.*** the King of Feathers can see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the King of Feathers fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The King of Feathers makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 ({@dice 4d12+7}) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 3d8+7}) bludgeoning damage.

***Summon Swarm (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The King of Feathers exhales a swarm of insects (wasps) that forms in a space within 20 feet of it. The swarm acts as an ally of the King of Feathers and takes its turn immediately after it. The swarm disperses after 1 minute. It can't use the Summon Swarm action while it is grappling a creature with its jaws.
