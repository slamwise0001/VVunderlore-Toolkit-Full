### Traits
***Latch On.*** When the skullbat hits a creature with its bite attack, its teeth burrow into the target, locking the skullbat tight to its victim's flesh. While the skullbat remains attached, the skullbat is restrained, but the target can move and act normally. The skullbat remains attached and is moved with the creature if the creature moves or is moved. A creature can use an action to attempt a Strength (Athletics) checks to grapple and remove the skullbat from itself or another creature within 5 feet, while the skullbat may detach at will without using an action. If the skullbat is detached in any way, it is no longer restrained. While the skullbat is attached to the target, it cannot use any actions or move. At the end of each of its turns, the skullbat automatically deals 14 ({@dice 4d6}) necrotic damage to the target and regains that many hit points.

***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** The skullbat takes 5 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage and 7 ({@dice 2d6}) necrotic damage. The skullbat regains an amount of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
