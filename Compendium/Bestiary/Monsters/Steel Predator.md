### Traits
***Deaf.*** The steel predator is permanently deafened.

***Ferrovore.*** The steel predator's bite deals double damage against objects and creatures consisting primarily of metal. It has advantage on attack rolls with its bite against creatures wearing armor or with natural armor consisting primarily of metal.

***Magic Sense.*** The steel predator senses the number and direction of every metallic magical object within 120 feet.

***Pounce.*** If the steel predator moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the steel predator can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

***Unmatched Smell.*** The steel predator automatically passes Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Its sense of smell is so accurate that it functions as blindsight with a range of 30 feet.


### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ( 3d8+6) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ( 3d6+6) slashing damage.

***Roar (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The steel predator emits a titanic roar in a 40-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, becoming deafened for 1 minute and taking 42 ( 12d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
