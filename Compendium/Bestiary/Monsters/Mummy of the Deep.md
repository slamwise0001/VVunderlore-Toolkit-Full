### Traits
***Control Water (1/Day).*** A mummy of the deep can control water as the spell by using an action.

***Curse of the Deep.*** When a mummy of the deep grapples a creature, it immediately uses a bonus action to press its mouth against the opponent's and spew sea water into the opponent's lungs. It then releases its grapple. The affected creature must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. An affected creature can act normally on a round when it makes a successful saving throw; if the saving throw fails, the creature takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of its next turn. The effect ends when the affected creature makes a third successful save. It can also be ended by a spell or other magical effect that neutralizes a curse.

***Despair.*** At the sight of a mummy of the deep within 60 feet, the viewer must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 1d4} rounds. If the saving throw result is 5 or less, the creature is paralyzed instead. A successful saving throw renders the creature immune to any mummy of the deep's despair for 24 hours.

### Actions
***Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) bludgeoning damage and a target of Medium size or smaller must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled; see Curse of the Deep above.
