### Traits
***Gal—Ralan.*** The shadar—kai wears a gal—ralan, the Constitution penalty is already included in its statistics. Hide in Plain Sight. As long as it is not illuminated by sunlight or a daylight spell, the shadar—kai can hide without having anything granting it concealment.

***Shadow Curse.*** Whenever the shadar—kai becomes incapacitated, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or lose a portion of its soul to the shadow plane. Its hit point maximum becomes permanently reduced by 4 ({@dice 1d8}). A shadar—kai whose hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect dies and cannot be resurrected, except with a true resurrection spell. A wish spell can restore the shadar—kai to its full hit point maximum.

***Shadow Lurker.*** The shadar—kai has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dark or shadowy conditions.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The shadar—kai deals an extra 3 ({@dice 1d6}) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the shadar—kai that isn't incapacitated and the shadar—kai doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Actions
***Chain Blade.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) piercing damage.
