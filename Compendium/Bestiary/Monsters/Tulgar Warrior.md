### Traits
***Forest Walk.*** The tulgar is not slowed by difficult terrain in natural forests.

***Powerful Grip.*** The tulgar ignores the twoâ€”handed quality of melee and thrown weapons. When wielding a weapon with the versatile quality, it always uses the higher damage die, even while wielding it in one hand.

***Unbroken Spirit.*** When the tulgar is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, the nearest ally of the tulgar gains 10 temporary hit points and advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The tulgar makes four attacks: three with its greataxe and one with its spear.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 1d12+7}) slashing damage.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d8+7}) piercing damage.
