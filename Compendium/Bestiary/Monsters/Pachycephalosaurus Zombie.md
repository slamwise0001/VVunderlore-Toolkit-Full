### Traits
***Shattered Skull Charge.*** If the pachycephalosaurus zombie moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 ({@dice 2d4}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it is poisoned until the end of the pachycephalosaurus zombie's next turn.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Ram.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage.
