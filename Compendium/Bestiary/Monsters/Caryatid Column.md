### Traits
***Immunity to Magic.*** A caryatid column automatically succeeds on all saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. If a successful saving throw reduces damage by half, the caryatid column takes no damage instead. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below (these effects override its immunity). " A stone shape spell cancels the caryatid column's immunity to magic for {@dice 1d4} rounds.

***Shatter Weapons.*** Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a melee weapon and the attack roll is a natural 1, 2, or 3, the character must make a Str check. The character's Str bonus is added to the roll, but the character's proficiency bonus and the weapon's magical bonus (if any) are subtracted from the roll. If the result is 15 or less, there is no effect. If the result is 16 or higher, the weapon shatters and becomes useless.

### Actions
***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d10+2}) slashing damage.
