# Chrysmal

![[Chrysmal.png]]

***The chrysmal is a prismed formation of translucent crystal, possessing 4-6 leg-like stumps that extend downward and a single crystalline limb protruding from its central trunk. Its movement is slow with a stiff, awkward gait. Native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, chrysmals have migrated to the Prime Material Plane, seeking lairs rich in crystal deposits to feed on. They do not digest flesh and are uninterested in beings from the Prime Material Plane, feeding instead on minerals like quartz and other crystalline formations. Chrysmals hold gemstones within them and are natural enemies of the xorn, who prey on them.***

***Striking a tuning fork within 20 feet confuses a chrysmal for 3 rounds (DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to resist). Chrysmals may ambush attackers by camouflaging as a crystal formation. For every three males, there will be a female, and for each female, 1d3 young chrysmals may be found.***

description: |
  The chrysmal is a prismed formation of translucent crystal. It possesses 4-6 leg-like stumps that extend down from its body and a single crystalline limb protruding upwards from the central trunk. Chrysmals are slow movers with a stiff, awkward gait and inhabit the Elemental Plane of Earth, although some have migrated to the Prime Material Plane to seek lairs rich in crystal deposits for feeding. Chrysmals ignore beings from the Prime Material Plane, as they cannot digest flesh, preferring instead to consume minerals like quartz.

  Inside each chrysmal is a collection of gemstones. Xorns prey on chrysmals, making them natural enemies. Striking a tuning fork within 20 feet will confuse a chrysmal for 3 rounds (DC 13 Wisdom saving throw negates). Chrysmals can move through earth, rock, or minerals with one round of preparation and reconstitute themselves upon re-emerging.

  Chrysmals defend themselves aggressively when provoked, using their camouflage and ability to pass through earth to ambush attackers. When encountered in groups, for every three males, there is one female, and for every female, there are 1d3 young.
