### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The crimson drake makes one bite attack and one stinger attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target takes 2 ({@dice 1d4}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 3 rounds. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect early.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 6).*** The drake exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each target in that cone takes 18 ({@dice 4d8}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
