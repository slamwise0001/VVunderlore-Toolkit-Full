### Traits
***Fear of Fire.*** If the cave fisher takes fire damage, it is frightened of the source of that damage for 1 round.

***Toxic Filament.*** The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. A creature that begins its turn adhered to the cave fisher's filament, must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. While poisoned, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be stunned for 1 round and take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) poison damage. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw on two consecutive turns, ends the poisoned condition on itself. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage; vulnerability to fire damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament deals no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn.

***Volatile Blood.*** If the cave fisher has half its maximum hit points or fewer, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it takes fire damage. If it fails the save, its blood combusts violently and the cave fisher takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) slashing damage.

***Spider Climb.*** The cave fisher can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cave fisher makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) slashing damage.

***Filament.*** One creature grappled by the cave fisher's toxic filament must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw, provided that the target weighs 200 pounds or less. On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can't extrude another filament.
