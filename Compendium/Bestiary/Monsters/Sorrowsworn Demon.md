### Traits
***Aura of Loss.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the sorrowsworn demon must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or gain disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws for one minute. At the end of each of its turns a creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature does not take disadvantage on this saving throw from the aura of loss unless it is still within 30 feet of the sorrowsworn demon.

***Whispers of Loss.*** As a bonus action sorrowsworn demon whispers to a creature within 60 feet of losses, past, present or future, real or imagined. If the target creature understands the sorrowsworn demon, it must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or become stunned for one minute. At the end of each of its turns a creature may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sorrowsworn demon makes three melee attacks: two with its glaive and one with its bite.

***Glaive.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@dice 3d8}) necrotic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken until it finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
