### Traits
***Sickening Aura.*** A fungus gargoyle stinks like rotting vegetable matter. Creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of a fungus gargoyle must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as they remain within 10 feet of any fungus gargoyle and for {@dice 1d4} rounds afterward.

***Spore Poisoning.*** A creature affected by spore poisoning must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour. On a successful saving throw, there is no effect; on a failed saving throw, the creature adds one level of exhaustion to its current exhaustion level. A creature can't recover from exhaustion while suffering from spore poisoning. The character recovers from exhaustion by normal means once the poison is neutralized with magic.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A fungus gargoyle attacks twice with claws or once with spore breath.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d10+2}) slashing damage.

***Spore Breath (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 10 ft. line, creatures in line. Hit: affected creatures must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion and suffer spore poisoning (see above).
