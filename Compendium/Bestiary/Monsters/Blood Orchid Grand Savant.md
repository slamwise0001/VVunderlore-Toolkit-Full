### Traits
***All-Around Vision.*** A blood orchid sees in all directions at once. Enemies never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against a blood orchid because of the presence of allies.

***Telepathic Bond.*** Blood orchids communicate through a nonmagical telepathic bond. They can sense emotions in other blood orchids at distances up to 100 feet, can communicate fully with each other through telepathy at a distance of 20 ft. or less, and can share vast amounts of information almost instantly when touching each other. They can sense emotions in other types of creatures when touching them or within 5 feet.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The blood orchid attacks six times, in any combination of tentacle slams and blood drain.

***Tenticle Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+4}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled.

***Blood Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature already grappled by the blood orchid at the start of the blood orchid's turn. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d8}) piercing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw against poison or become unconscious. Unconscious characters can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns; they regain consciousness on a successful save. A creature that makes a successful save against this attack becomes immune to the blood drain's unconsciousness effect for 24 hours.
