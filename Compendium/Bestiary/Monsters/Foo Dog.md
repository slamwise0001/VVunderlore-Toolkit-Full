### Traits
***Aura.*** A foo dog is protected by an aura of goodness. An evil-aligned creature that attacks a foo creature takes a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls.

***Invisibility.*** A foo dog can become invisible as a bonus action. It becomes visible again when it attacks.

***Planar Travel.*** A foo dog can shift between the Astral, Ethereal, and Material Planes during its move. Crossing the boundary from one plane to another costs the foo dog 30 feet of movement. It can transport only itself into or out of the Ethereal Plane, but it can bring up to eight other willing creatures with it across the Astral boundary, with effects and restrictions identical to the astral projection spell.

***Resilient.*** A foo dog has tactical advantage on all saving throws.

***Strike Evil.*** Foo dogs have a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls when fighting evil-aligned creatures.

***Summon Foo Creatures (1/Day).*** Once per day as an action, a foo dog can summon up to four additional foo dogs by barking for them. Roll {@dice 4d4}; one foo dog appears within 20 feet of the summoning foo dog for each die that rolls a 4. Foo dogs summoned this way can't summon more foo dogs.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d10+3}) piercing damage.
