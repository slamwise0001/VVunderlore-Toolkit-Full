### Traits
***Sylvan Warrior.*** A banshrae's armor class is 10 + its Charisma modifier + its Dexterity modifier.

***Blowgun Flute.*** At will, the banshrae can call into being a flute that also acts as a blowgun, as if drawing a weapon that is on its person. This flute disappears if the banshrae loses possession of it. Each round the banshrae can play the flute as a bonus action to create one of the effects detailed below. Creatures witin a 60 ft. radius that can hear the Banshrae must succeed on a DC 14 wisdom saving throw, or are affected.

***Dread Dirge.*** Affected creatures are frightened of the banshrae until the end of its next turn. Gibbering Sing—Along. Affected creatures are compelled to sing along in incoherent sounds, automatically failing all Dexterity (Stealth) checks trying to be inaudible and unable to cast spells using verbal components or abilities relying on voice or speech until the end of the banshrae's next turn. Creatures singing along to the tune can be heard clearly over the music.

***Traveller's Tune.*** Affected creatures must move on their next turn, and end their move at least 20 feet from the starting point or as far as they can if they are slowed by difficult terrain or their speed is less than that.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The banshrae makes three attacks with any combination of unarmed strikes and blowgun shots. Unarmed strike. Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or it gains disadvantage on Dexterity checks on saving throws for the next 24 hours.

***Blowgun.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1 + 4) piercing damage.

***Dart Salvo (recharge 5—6).*** The banshrae fires a hail of blow darts in a 20 foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
