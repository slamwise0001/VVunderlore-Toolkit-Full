### Traits
***Displacement.*** The ghirrash projects a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the ghirrash is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.

***Magic Resistance.*** The shadow beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Pounce.*** If the ghirrash moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a weapon attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the ghirrash can make two claw attacks against it as a bonus action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The ghirrash makes three melee attacks, one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for one minute. At the end of each of its turns the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) slashing damage.
