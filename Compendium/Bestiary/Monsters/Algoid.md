### Traits
***Animate Trees.*** An algoid can innately cast the animate objects spell at will, requiring no components. Each casting animates two trees, which are all the algoid can control at a time. A newly animated tree takes one full round to uproot itself. Once free, trees act on the algoid's turn.

***Vulnerability to Water Magic.*** Control water and destroy water spells deal {@dice 3d6} piercing damage to an algoid (no save).

***Water Camouflage.*** An algoid has tactical advantage on Stealth checks when it has any type of standing water to blend into.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The algoid slams twice or attacks once with its mind blast.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage. If an algoid scores a critical hit with this attack, the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; the condition ends on a successful save.

***Mind Blast.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: automatic hit (range 60 ft. cone; creatures in the cone). Hit: creatures in the cone must make a successful DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for {@dice 3d4} rounds.
