### Traits
***Trampling Charge.*** If the triceratops zombie moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the triceratops zombie can make one stop attack against it as a bonus action.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 ({@dice 4d8+6}) piercing damage.

***Stomp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 22 ({@dice 3d10+6}) bludgeoning damage.
