### Traits
***Immutable Form.*** The clockwork huntsman is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The clockwork huntsman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) bludgeoning damage.

***Net Cannon.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 5/15 ft., one target, size Large or smaller. Hit: the target is restrained. A mechanism within the clockwork huntsman's chest can fire a net with a 20-foot trailing cable anchored within the huntsman's chest. A creature can free itself (or another creature) from the net by using its action to make a successful DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the net. The huntsman can fire up to four nets before it must be reloaded.

***Explosive Core.*** The mechanism that powers the huntsman explodes when the construct is destroyed, projecting superheated steam and shrapnel. Every creature within 5 ft. of the construct takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
