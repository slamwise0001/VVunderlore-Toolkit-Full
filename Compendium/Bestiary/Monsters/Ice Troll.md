### Traits
***Freezing Metabolism.*** When the troll regains at least 1 hit point, all its limbs grow back. Each time the troll regenerates a limb or more, ice spikes appear over its body and the troll gains new bonuses and drawbacks:
- **1st time**: +2 cold damage with each attack  
- **2nd time**: +4 cold damage and -10 ft. speed  
- **3rd time**: +7 cold damage and -20 ft. speed  

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes fire or acid damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. The troll still lives with 0 hit points; in this state, the troll dies if it takes 5 or more acid or fire damage.

***Troll Limbs.*** When the troll takes 15 slashing damage or more in a single hit or suffers a critical hit, one of its limbs is cut off (attacker’s choice) and lands in an unoccupied space adjacent to the troll. While limbless, the troll has disadvantage on attack rolls. The limb mutates and turns into a swarm of troll limbs (CR 1/8).

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The troll makes three Claw attacks, or one Claw attack and one Bite attack.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller dead or dying creature, the troll swallows it whole and regains 1 hit point. If the creature is still alive, it dies inside the troll’s belly.

### Reactions
***Hammer Fist.*** When a creature moves out of the troll’s reach, the troll may attack it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
