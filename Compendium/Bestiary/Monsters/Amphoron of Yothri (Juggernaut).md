### Traits
***Processing.*** The juggernaut amphoron is equipped with a large, moving crane mounted on its back. In addition to attacking with its whirling saw blades, the juggernaut can pick up one creature per round with its crane and hoist it aloft. On that creature's turn, it can make a Strength (Athletics) saving throw or Dexterity (Acrobatics) saving throw (with tactical disadvantage if the creature is wearing metal armor, because of the magnets in the crane), opposed by the juggernaut's Strength check. If the creature wins the contest, it struggles free from the crane and drops harmlessly to the ground. If the juggernaut wins the contest, then on its next turn, it drops the creature into the processing chamber. Any creature dropped through the hatch is immediately reduced to 0 hit points and must make a death saving throw each turn until either it dies or the juggernaut amphoron is destroyed; a dying creature can't stabilize inside a juggernaut's processing chamber. If the creature dies, it emerges from the juggernaut's ejection hatch on the juggernaut's next turn as a brick of processed concentrate. A death saving throw is not required on a turn when the juggernaut flickers.

***Flicker.*** Roll {@dice 1d6} for every amphoron in play at the start of its turn. On a roll of 1, the amphoron "flickers" due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. Flickering lasts until the start of the amphoron's next turn. While flickering, the amphoron can't be attacked and can't inflict damage. It regains 2 hit points when it rematerializes. A controller flickers only on a roll of 1 on {@dice 1d20}, but if it does, all amphorons under its control also flicker.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The amphoron attacks twice with whirling saw blades and once with its crane.

***Whirling Saw Blades.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+4}) slashing damage.

***Crane.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: target is grappled and lifted by the crane to be dropped into the juggernaut's processing chamber on the juggernaut's next turn (see Processing, above).
