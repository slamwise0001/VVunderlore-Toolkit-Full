### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) bludgeoning damage, plus 5 ({@dice 2d4}) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until the grapple ends, the giant spitting lizard can only bite the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.
