### Traits
***Void Travel.*** The dragon does not need to breathe and is immune to the hazards of outer space. It can fly beyond a planet's atmosphere and travel between planets. Travelling between planets using the void travel ability requires {@dice 6d10} days of travel time regardless of the actual distance. Riders it carries while travelling through space are also protected from the void of outer space.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Alien Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ({@dice 2d10+6}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d6+6}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Blinding Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Blinding Presence for the next 24 hours.
