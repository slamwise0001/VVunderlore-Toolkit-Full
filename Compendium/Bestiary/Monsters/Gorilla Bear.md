### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A gorilla bear attacks twice with claws.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled and restrained, and it takes an additional 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage. The grapple ends automatically at the start of the gorilla bear's next turn, if the creature hasn't escaped before then.
