### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The giganotosaurus can make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can use Swallow instead of its bite.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 34 ({@dice 4d12+8}) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the giganotosaurus can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 26 ({@dice 4d8+8}) bludgeoning damage.

***Swallow.*** The giganotosaurus makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the giganotosaurus, and it takes 21 ({@dice 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the giganotosaurus' turns.If the giganotosaurus takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the giganotosaurus must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the giganotosaurus. If the giganotosaurus dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Legendary Actions
***Momentum.*** The giganotosaurus moves its speed. Tail Sweep. (2 Actions) The giganotosaurus sweeps its tail in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Roar (3 Actions).*** Creatures within 20 feet of the giganotosaurus that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the giganotosaurus until the end of its next turn.
