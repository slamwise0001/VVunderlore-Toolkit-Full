### Traits
***Aura of Darkness.*** A type 2 grue is permanently enveloped by a sphere of darkness with a 15-foot diameter. Other than the aura's size and duration, it behaves exactly as the darkness spell.

***Extinguish Light.*** As a bonus action, a grue can extinguish one normal (nonmagical) light within 100 feet.

***Soul Devourer.*** The body of any creature killed by a grue, along with everything it wore or carried, fades from existence {@dice 1d6} x 10 minutes after its death unless it is protected by magic such as a gentle repose spell. Four days later, the vanished person's soul returns as a grue, and it becomes impossible for the slain creature to ever be raised.

***Spell Immunity.*** The only spells that affect a type 2 grue are those that do radiant damage.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d8+3}) piercing damage and the grue heals half as many hit points.
