### Traits
***Arcane Sight.*** Elusa hounds detect magical auras as if they are under a permanent detect magic spell with a radius of 120 feet. This has the added benefit that an elusa hound can instantly identify any spellcaster within range.

***Aura Tracking.*** Once an elusa hound has seen the magical aura of a living creature with its arcane sight ability, or has seen the magical residue of a spell or effect created by a particular spellcaster or other creature, it gets tactical advantage on Survival checks to follow that spellcaster's trail. The trail must be no more than three hours old for the elusa hound to get this bonus.

***Stand Guard.*** When an elusa hound knocks a target prone, it can choose to grapple the target automatically. The target can't stand up unless it first escapes the grapple. While the hound has a target grappled, it can bite only that creature.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature,. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
