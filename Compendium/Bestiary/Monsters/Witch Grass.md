### Traits
***Defenseless.*** Witch grass plants automatically fail saving throws.

***Magic Damping.*** When an arcane spellcaster tries to cast an arcane spell within 20 feet of a patch of witch grass, the caster must make an Int or Cha saving throw; use the ability most appropriate to the spellcasters class. The DC equals 10 + the size of the patch in 10 ft. squares (see Organization, above). For example, if a wizard tries to cast a spell near a 30-square-foot patch of witch grass, she must make a successful DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell is cast normally. If the saving throw fails, the spell is not cast but the spell slot is not expended. Only arcane magic is affected.

***Seeds.*** Witch grass seeds attach themselves to anything they come in contact with. Seeds have the same magic damping effect as the plants, but their range is only 10 feet and the DC to overcome their effect is always 11. The effect lasts for 12 hours, then the seeds lose their potency. A close inspection of clothing and gear, plus a successful DC 8 Intelligence (Nature) check, reveals the presence of the seeds. Once theyre identified, seeds can be eliminated by spending an hour washing and thoroughly cleaning clothes, animals, and equipment.
