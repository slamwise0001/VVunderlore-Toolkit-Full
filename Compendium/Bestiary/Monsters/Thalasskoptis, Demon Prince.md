### Traits
***Toxic Ink (3/Day).*** Thalasskoptis can squirt a cloud of poisonous ink into air or water. The ink creates a sphere 60 feet in radius centered on Thalasskoptis, and it lasts for one minute. The cloud is stationary; it doesn't move with Thalasskoptis. The area inside the cloud is heavily obscured. Creatures other than Thalasskoptis in the ink cloud must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw against poison or be stunned for as long as they remain inside the ink cloud.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Thalasskoptis attacks four times with tentacles, or it attacks twice with tentacles and either uses one spelllike ability or emits a toxic ink cloud.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d10+4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target of this attack is a stunned creature, the attack is automatically a critical hit.

### Legendary Actions
***Bite.*** {@hit +8} to hit, one creature grappled by Thalasskoptis. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for {@dice 1d6} rounds and take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage.

***Spell-Like Ability.*** Thalasskoptis uses one at-will spell-like ability.

***Tentacle Grab.*** Thalasskoptis makes one tentacle attack. If this attack hits, the target is also grappled.
