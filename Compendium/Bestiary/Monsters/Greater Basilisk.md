### Traits
***Foul Breath.*** A greater basilisk's breath is extremely foul. Any creature adjacent to a greater basilisk's head (within 5 feet of its head, this applies automatically to anyone targeted by the basilisk's bite) must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure indicates the creature is poisoned (per the condition) until it moves more than 5 feet away from the basilisk's head and then makes a successful save at the end of its turn. A successful save means the creature is immune to this basilisk's breath for 24 hours.

***Gaze.*** A living creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of a greater basilisk must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure indicates the creature begins turning to stone; it immediately becomes restrained, and it must make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn. Success on the second saving throw ends this effect. Failure on the second saving throw means the creature is petrified. A creature that is capable of taking actions can look away to avoid the greater basilisk's gaze, but if it targets the basilisk while averting its gaze, the creature suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target. Creatures that are blind, unconscious, or unable to see the greater basilisk for any other reason are immune to this attack.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The greater basilisk bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+4}) piercing damage plus {@dice 3d6} poison damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+4}) slashing damage plus {@dice 2d6} poison damage.
