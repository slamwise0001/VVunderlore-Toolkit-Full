### Traits
***Swallow.*** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the gulper's turns. Up to four Medium creatures can be inside the gulper at one time; two Small or smaller creatures count as one Medium creature. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the gulper or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the gulper by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the gulper is dead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d8+3}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be swallowed (see above).
