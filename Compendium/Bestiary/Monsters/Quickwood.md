### Traits
***Fear Aura.*** If a quickwood makes a successful saving throw against a spell that would have damaged it, the quickwood takes no damage but instead absorbs some of the spells energy and immediately releases it as a fear spell in a 30-foot radius instead of a cone. Saving throws against this fear are made against DC 12.

***Grasping Roots.*** A creature grappled by a quickwood can break free with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or by inflicting 10 slashing damage against the grappling root, thereby severing it from the plant. Roots have AC 14. Damage done to a root is not subtracted from the plants overall hit points, and severing a root doesnt reduce the quickwoods number of root attacks. If a creature is grappled by more than one root, each root must be severed or overpowered individually.

***Remote Sensing.*** A quickwood can see and hear through any normal oak tree within 360 feet of the quickwood. It can see and hear through up to ten oak trees at a time, and it can drop one tree and add another as a bonus action once per round. An oak tree utilized as a magical sensor develops a vaguely humanlike visage on its trunk that seems to peer around itself.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A quickwood bites once and attacks four times with its roots.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d8+5}) piercing damage. This attack roll has tactical advantage against a target thats grappled by the quickwood.

***Root.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d10+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and dragged 15 feet closer to the quickwood. This attack roll has tactical advantage against a target thats already grappled by the quickwood.
