### Traits
***Pheromone.*** If the howler wasp queen is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by a melee attack, before it dies or falls unconscious, it can as a reaction spray the attacker with a pheromone that incites other howler wasps to violently pursue the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be doused in the pheromone. While the creature is doused, other howler wasps have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. The pheromone fades after 10 minutes, or can be washed off by submerging the creature in water.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The howler wasp queen makes three melee attacks, one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d4+4}) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@dice 3d8}) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until it finishes a long rest.
