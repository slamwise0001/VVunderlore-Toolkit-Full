### Traits
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Mithral Shards.*** Ancient mithral dragons can choose to retain the mithral shards of their breath weapon as a hazardous zone of spikes. Treat as a spike growth zone that does {@dice 2d8} magical slashing damage for every 5 feet travelled.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 22 ({@dice 2d12+9}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ({@dice 2d8+9}) slashing damage, and the target loses 5 hit point from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is cumulative; the target loses 5 hp per round for each bleeding wound it's taken from a mithral dragon's claws.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +15} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 2d10+9}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5â€”6).*** A mithral dragon can spit a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets in its path take 59 ({@dice 17d6}) magical slashing damage and lose another 10 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns for 6 rounds; slashing and bleed damage is halved by a successful DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. Only magical healing stops the bleeding before 6 rounds. The shards dissolve into wisps of smoke 1 round after the breath weapon's use.

### Legendary Actions
***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 ({@dice 2d8+9}) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
