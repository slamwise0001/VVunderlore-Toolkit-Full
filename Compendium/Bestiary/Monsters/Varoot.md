### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The nerra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spell Reflection.*** If the nerra succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect or is missed by a spell attack that only targets the nerra, the nerra takes no damage and the effect or attack is reflected back to the caster, which must make a save against the spell or roll to hit against itself.

### Actions
***Shard Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.

***Shard Dagger.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.

***Mirror Jump.*** The nerra touches a mirror or any reflective surface within 5 feet of it and immediately is transported to any other such surface within 5 miles. It exits within 5 feet of that surface.
