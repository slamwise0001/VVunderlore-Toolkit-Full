### Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d8+1}) piercing damage.

***Necrotic Spit.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +2} to hit, range 10/20 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 3d6}) necrotic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the condition on a success.
