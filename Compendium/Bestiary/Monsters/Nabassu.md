### Traits
***Demonic Shadows.*** The nabassu darkens the area around its body in a 10-foot radius. Nonmagical light can't illuminate this area of dim light.

***Devour Soul.*** A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 ( 1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a wish spell.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The nabassu's weapon attacks are magical.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ( 2d10+6) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 ( 4d12+6) piercing damage.

***Soul-Stealing Gaze.*** The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 ( 2d12) damage and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul under the nabassu's control.
