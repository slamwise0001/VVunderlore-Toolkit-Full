### Traits
***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The broom is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the broom must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the broom remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal broom.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The broom makes two melee attacks.

***Broomstick.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) bludgeoning damage.
