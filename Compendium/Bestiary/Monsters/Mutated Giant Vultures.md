### Traits
***Drink Blood.*** If a mutated giant vulture hits a creature with a beak attack, it can use a bonus action to have the eel tentacles on its face drain the target’s blood. This reduces the maximum hits points of the creature by 2. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The mutated giant vulture has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The mutated giant vulture has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the vulture’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The vulture makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d4+2}) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) slashing damage.
