### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The avathu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The avathu makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its stingers.

***Rotting Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ({@dice 3d6+7}) piercing damage plus 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is permanently reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage

***taken.*** A remove curse spell or similar magic restores the creature's maximum hit points.

***Stingers.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 4d6+7}) piercing damage.

***Maddening Form (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the avathu that can see it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 31 ({@dice 7d8}) psychic damage and gain disadvantage on charisma checks and saving throws for one minute as it goes mad. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
