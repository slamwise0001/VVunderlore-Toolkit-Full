### Traits
***Angelic Weapons.*** The archon's weapon attacks are magical. When the archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra {@dice 3d8} radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Axiomatic Mind.*** The archon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.

***Magic Resistance.*** The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***One Being.*** Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount, an archon is a single being. The "rider" can't be dismounted, and no other means can separate the two portions of the archon's being short of its death.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The archon makes two attacks: one with its sword and one with its claws.

***Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) slashing damage plus 13 ({@dice 3d8}) radiant damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d6+4}) piercing damage plus 13 ({@dice 3d8}) radiant damage.
