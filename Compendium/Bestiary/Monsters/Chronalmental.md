### Traits
***Temporal Body.*** When a chronalmental is subjected to a slow spell, haste spell, or similar effect, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw and regains 13 ({@dice 3d8}) hit points.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The chronalmental makes {@dice 1d4+1 }slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Steal Time (1/Day).*** The chronalmental targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the chronalmental draws some of the creature's time into itself and gains +10 to its position in initiative order. In addition, the target's speed is reduced by half, it can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. While it is stealing time, the chronalmental's speed increases by 30 feet, and when it takes the multiattack action, it can make an additional slam attack. The targeted creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Displace (Recharge 5â€”6).*** The chronalmental targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically shunted outside of time. The creature disappears for 1 minute. As an action, the displaced creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the target returns to its previously occupied space, or the nearest unoccupied space.
