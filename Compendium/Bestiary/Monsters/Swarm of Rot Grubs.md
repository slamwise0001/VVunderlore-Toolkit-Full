### Traits
***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny maggot. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

### Actions
***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +0} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: The target is infested by {@dice 1d4} rot grubs. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes {@dice 1d6} piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.
