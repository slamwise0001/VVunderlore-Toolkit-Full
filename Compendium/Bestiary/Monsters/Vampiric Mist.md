### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The vampiric mist can move through any space large enough for air to pass through, without squeezing.

***Fog Camouflage.*** The vampiric mist has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in fog. If the fog is dense enough to generally grant advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in it, the vampiric mist is invisible inside it.

***Seize.*** When the vampiric mist hits a creature with its blood draining touch, its incorporeal tendrils seize the opponent. The target is not grappled, but it cannot move away from the vampiric mist while seized and the vampiric mist can hit the seized creature with its blood draining touch automatically. The seized creature may use its action to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Stength (Athletics) check to end the effect on itself. If the target is moved out of the vampiric mist's reach or the vampiric mist is incapacitated, the effect ends.

***Sense Blood.*** The vampiric mist can only sense living warmâ€”blooded creatures with its blindsight.

***Split.*** A vampiric mist that has 168 maximum hit points or more immediately splits into two individual vampiric mists, each with a current hit point total equal to half the original mist's current hit points and 84 maximum hit points. Both of these mists continue to use the original mist's initiative.


### Actions
***Blood Draining Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ( 4d8) necrotic damage, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt, and the vampiric mist's hit point maximum and current hitpoints are increased by the same amount.
