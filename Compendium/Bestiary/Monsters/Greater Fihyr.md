### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The fihyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Lock Picking.*** The fihyr can use its tentacles to attempt Dexterity checks to open locks.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The fihyr can use its frightful gibbering. It then makes two melee attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bites.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 24 ({@dice 5d8+2}) piercing damage

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the fihyr can't use its tentacles on another target.

***Frightful Gibbering.*** Each creature of the fihyr's choice that is in a 30 foot radius around the fihyr and can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the fihyr's frightful gibbering for the next 24 hours.

***Emotion Control.*** The fihyr magically projects a powerful emotion to a point within 100 feet. Creatures within a 15-foot-radius sphere around that point must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed by one of the following emotions of the fihyr's choice for one minute. Despair: Affected creatures gain disadvantage on saving throws, attack rolls and ability checks. Fear: Affected creatures become frightened of the fihyr. Hate: Affected creatures treat all other creatures except for their bonded or summoned companions such as their beast companions, familiars, and creatures conjured or magically created by them as enemies and will attack the closest target as directly as possible.

***Invisibility.*** The fihyr becomes invisible. It remains invisible until it attacks or uses its frightful presence or emotion control ability.
