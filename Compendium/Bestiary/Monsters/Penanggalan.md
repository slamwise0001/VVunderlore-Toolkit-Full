### Traits
***Fear Aura.*** A creature starting its turn within 30 feet of the penanggalan must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the penanggalan for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wurm's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Alternate Form.*** The penanggalan can attach itself to its body again, using an action, after soaking its entrails in vinegar. While in this form, its speed becomes 30 feet and it loses its fly speed. It also loses its immunity to the prone condition and bite and entrail attack and cannot be detected by the detect good and evil spell. As a bonus action, the penanggalan can return to its natural form, leaving its body behind once more.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the penanggalan, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@dice 3d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the penanggalan regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way, that is not buried within 3 days, rises as a penanggalan.

***Entrails.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d10+4}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the penanggalan can automatically hit the target with its entrails as an action or bonus action, and the penanggalan can't make entrail attacks against another target. Because the penanggalan seizes the victims neck, the creature can't breathe, speak, or cast spells with verbal components.

***Domination.*** The penanggalan targets a creature within 60 feet of itself. If the two can see each other, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw as if targeted by a dominate monster spell.
