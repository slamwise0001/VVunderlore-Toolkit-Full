### Traits
***Hang.*** When a creature fails the saving throw from a constriction attack, the hangman tree hoists it off the ground by the vine around the target's neck. The creature is still grappled, and it runs out of breath and begins suffocating.

***Paralyzed by Cold.*** A hangman tree is paralyzed for 1 round if it fails a Constitution saving throw after taking cold damage. The DC of the saving throw equals the spellcaster's standard DC.

***Slowed by Darkness.*** Spells that engulf the hangman tree in darkness affect it as the slow spell for {@dice 1d4} rounds.

***Vines.*** The vines of a hangman tree have AC 15 and 10 hit points. Only slashing damage affects them. Damage done to a vine is not subtracted from the hangman tree's overall total and does not reduce its number of vine attacks (the tree has plenty of vines to replace any that are severed).

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A hangman tree attacks four times with vines and constriction in any mix, or it can release hallucinatory spores (see below).

***Vine.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Because the tree seizes targets by the neck, a creature grappled by the hangman tree can't speak or cast spells with verbal components.

***Constriction.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the hangman tree at the start of the tree's turn. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Strength saving throw or be lifted off the ground and hanged (see above).

***Hallucinatory Spores.*** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 50 ft. cloud centered on tree, creatures in range. Hit: creatures must make successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throws or be charmed by the tree for {@dice 2d6} minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other friendly tree creature). An affected creature won't attack the hangman tree for any reason while charmed. A successful saving throw renders a creature immune to this tree's hallucinatory spores for 24 hours.
