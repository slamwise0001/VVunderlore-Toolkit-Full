### Traits
***Bloodthirst.*** The bloodfiend has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are currently below their maximum hit points.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The blood fiend can use its frightful presence. It then makes five melee attacks, one with its bite and four with its claws

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d8+7}) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d8+7}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature that is not undead or a construct, the blood fiend heals 9 ({@dice 2d8}) hit points immediately. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the blood fiend can't bite another creature.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the blood fiend's choice that is in a 15 foot radius around the blood fiend and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blood fiend's frightful presence for the next 24 hours.
