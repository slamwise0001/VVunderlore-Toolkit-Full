### Traits
***Amphibious.*** The bhasylit can breathe air and water.

### Actions
***Mucus.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 2d4}) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be restrained. A creature can use its action to free itself or another creature within 5 feet from the mucus, ending the condition on that creature.

***Hypnotic Form (1/Day).*** Each creature within 10 feet of the bhasylit that can see it must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw, or gain disadvantage on attack rolls for one minute as the bhasylit's flowing motions mesmerize it. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.
