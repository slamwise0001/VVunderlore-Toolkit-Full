### Traits
***Aversion to Daylight.*** Boneneedles shun light. While exposed to natural (not magical) sunlight, they have tactical disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

***Boneneedle Poison.*** The bite of a boneneedle injects a syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and weakens bone. A creature that fails its saving throw against boneneedle poison gains the poisoned condition. While the creature is poisoned by boneneedle poison, it also takes an extra 2 points of damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Cumulative bites do not increase the extra damage. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw after a long or short rest, ending the poisoned condition with a successful save. A lesser restoration spell or comparable magic also neutralizes the poison.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+3}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, suffering the effect of boneneedle poison (see above).
