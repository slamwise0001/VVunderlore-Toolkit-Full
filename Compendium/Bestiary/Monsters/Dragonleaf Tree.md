### Traits
***Damage Immunities.*** A dragonleaf tree enjoys the same immunities as its progenitor. Black, copper, and green trees are immune to acid damage; blue and bronze trees are immune to lightning damage; brass, gold, and red trees are immune to fire damage; and silver and white trees are immune to cold damage.

***Loyal to Dragon Master.*** A dragonleaf tree only follows commands from its designated master (or from any creatures to whom the master grants control). It has advantage on saving throws against any charm or compulsion spell or effect. Additionally, the tree has advantage on any saving throw to resist Bluff, Diplomacy, or intimidation checks made to influence it to act against its masters.

***Weaknesses.*** Dragonleaf trees with immunity to fire also have vulnerability to cold, and trees with immunity to cold have vulnerability to fire.

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 58 ({@dice 10d10+3}) bludgeoning damage.

***Leaves.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 45 ({@dice 10d8}) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapon (Recharge 6).*** A dragonleaf tree can issue forth a breath weapon from its leaves appropriate to the dragon it honors. The creature's breath weapon deals 49 ({@dice 14d6}) damage, or half damage to targets that make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A black, copper, or green tree breathes a 60-foot line of acid; a blue or bronze tree breathes a 60-foot line of lightning; a brass, gold, or red tree breathes a 30-foot cone of fire; and a silver or white tree breathes a 30-foot cone of cold.
