### Traits
***Lethargy.*** By speaking, singing, or roaring, the lionwere causes all creatures that can hear it and that are within 60 feet of it to make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of a slow spell lasting {@dice 1d6} rounds. A creature that saves successfully is immune to lethargy until after its next long rest. Therianthropes are immune to lethargy.

***Shapechanger.*** The lionwere can change from its lion form or human form to its hybrid form as a bonus action. Changing from lion form directly to human form or vice versa takes an action. The lionwere is Large in lion form but Medium in human or hybrid form. In lion form, it is indistinguishable from a normal lion.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** In hybrid form, a lionwere attacks twice with claws or once with its greatsword. In human form, it attacks once with its greatsword. In lion form, it makes two melee attacks and can also use its lethargy ability.

***Bite (lion form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) piercing damage.

***Claws (lion/hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) slashing damage.

***Greatsword (human/hybrid form).*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) slashing damage.
