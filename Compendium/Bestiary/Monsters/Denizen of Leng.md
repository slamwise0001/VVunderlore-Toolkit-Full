### Traits
***Regeneration.*** At the start of its turn, a denizen of Leng regains 5 lost hit points. This ability fails to function only if the creature is utterly cut off from Leng; e.g., if its ability to plane shift is negated. If a denizen of Leng is reduced to 0 hit points while it is still capable of regenerating, its body dissipates into vapor in {@dice 1d4} rounds, leaving only its clothing and equipment behind, and it returns to life on Leng.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, a denizen of Leng can do an extra 14 ({@dice 4d6}) damage with a claw or bite attack if the denizen has advantage on the attack or if one of its allies is within 5 feet of the target.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A denizen of Leng bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or immediately gain one level of exhaustion.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) slashing damage.
