### Traits
***Pyrotechnics (1/Day).*** As an action, a pyrolisk can cause an ordinary fire within 120 feet of it to flare into a burst of sparks and light. This burst is so bright that all creatures able to see the fire and within 60 feet of it must make a successful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for {@dice 1d4} rounds. Pyrolisks are immune to this effect.

### Actions
***Beak.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d4+2}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or burst into flames, taking 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage immediately plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage at the start of each of the pyrolisks turns for as long as the flames burn. A creature can extinguish flames on itself or on an adjacent creature by using an action to make a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Survival) check.
