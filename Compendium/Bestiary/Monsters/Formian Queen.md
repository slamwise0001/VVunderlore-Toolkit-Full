### Traits
***Hive Mind.*** Formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant telepathic communication and share experiences and thoughts constantly, when one formian is aware of something, they all are.

***Immobile.*** The formian queen is incapable of moving. Her speed is always 0 feet and it can't be increased beyond that. She cannot use any actions that require moving her body in any way. Attack rolls against the formian queen have advantage and she automatically fails Dexterity and Strength saving throws.

***Magic Resistance.*** The formian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Thought Components.*** The formian queen ignores all component requirements for both her innate spells and sorcerer spells.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The formian queen casts two different spells of up to 5th level that require a spell attack roll. One of these spells can also be magic missile.
