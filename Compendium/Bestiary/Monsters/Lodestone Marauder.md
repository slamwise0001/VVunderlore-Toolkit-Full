### Traits
***Magnetic Defense.*** When attacked with melee attacks using metal weapons or ranged attacks using metallic projectiles, a lodestone marauder can choose to cause the attacks to have advantage or disadvantage to hit.

***Magnetic Surge.*** Using a bonus action, the lodestone marauder can use the magnetic field surrounding it to repulse or attract metallic objects. Any creature within 30 feet of the lodestone Marauder, wielding weapons or shields or wearing armor made substantially of metal must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or drop any metallic weapons and, if they are wearing metallic armor, be knocked prone. Unattended metallic objects and prone creatures are then moved in a straight line directly toward or away from the lodestone marauder, depending on whether it chose to repulse or attract them. If the marauder chose to repulse, creatures and objects come to a stop 30 feet away from the marauder. If the marauder chose to attract creatures and objects are pulled onto the marauder's back where they stick magnetically. A creature pulled onto a lodestone marauder's back is restrained and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) piercing damage. A creature may use its action to pull itself, another creature or an object free of the lodestone marauders back by making a successful DC 15 Strength check. Andy objects and creatures are automatically released the next time the marauder uses its ability to repulse.

***Metal Sense.*** A lodestone marauder can sense metal within 30 feet of it, from changes in its magnetic field, as though it had blindsight up to that range.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The lodestone marauder makes two melee attacks: one with its bite, and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ({@dice 2d6+5}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) slashing damage.
