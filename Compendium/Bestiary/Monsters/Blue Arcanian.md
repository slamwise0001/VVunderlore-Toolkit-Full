### Traits
***Arcane Surge (Recharge after Short or Long Rest).*** If the arcanian hits a creature with a spell attack, it may choose to double the dice rolled for cold damage.

### Actions
***Frost Staff.*** Melee Spell Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 ({@dice 1d8}) bludgeoning damage plus 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) cold damage.

***Freezing Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) cold damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of the arcanian's next turn.

***Blizzard (Recharge 4â€”6).*** The arcanian magically evokes a maelstrom of cold around itself that lasts until the start of the arcanian's next turn. Creatures that start or end their turn within 30 feet of the arcanian must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 ({@dice 6d8+4}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful

***one.*** Creatures other than the arcanian treat the area within 30 feet of the arcanian as difficult terrain and have disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made in the area.
