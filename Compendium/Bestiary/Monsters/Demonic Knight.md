### Traits
***Create Spawn.*** Any humanoid slain by a demonic knight's breath of unlife returns to life in {@dice 2d4} rounds as a shadow demon under the command of the demonic knight that created it. The new shadow demon remains enslaved to the demonic knight until the knight's death. They do not retain any of the abilities they had in life.

***Summon Demonic Aid (1/Day).*** Once per day as an action, a demonic knight can summon additional demons to his side. He can summon {@dice 1d4} shadow demons, 2 glabrezus or hezrous, or 1 vrock or marilith. To complete the summoning, the demonic knight must make a successful DC 18 Cha check (normally a 50% chance). The summoned demons teleport into empty spaces within 60 feet of the demon knight, of his choosing, and remain until they're slain or for one hour.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A demonic knight attacks once with its anarchic longsword and once with either its breath of unlife or its fist.

***Anarchic Longsword.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d10+6}) slashing, magic damage (treat as magic damage).

***Mailed Fist.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 1d8+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Breath of Unlife (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Ranged Attack: automatic hit, range 10 ft. cone, creatures in the cone. Hit: 33 ({@dice 6d10}) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies instantly; see Create Spawn above.
