### Traits
***Spider Climb.*** The harpoon spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Spines.*** A creature touching the harpoon spider takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) piercing damage.

***Web Walker.*** The harpoon spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The harpoon spider makes two ranged attacks with its fangs. It does not incur disadvantage from being within melee range of an enemy.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+6}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

***Fang.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, range 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+6}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) poison damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) and pulled directly toward the harpoon spider to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The harpoon spider may make a bite attack against the target as a bonus action. The harpoon spider has two fangs, each of which can grapple one target. Until the grapple ends, the harpoon spider can't use the fang to attack.

***Impale.*** The harpoon spider attempts to impale a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling on its backspikes. It makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the harpoon spider is successful, the grapple ends and the creature takes 15 ({@dice 3d6+5}) piercing damage and is restrained on the harpoon spider's back. A creature can use an action to attempt to pull itself or another creature in arm's reach free from the spikes by making a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the impaled creature is no longer restrained and drops off the harpoon spider's back, immediately being moved to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the harpoon spider. The harpoon spider can have up to six Medium or smaller creatures impaled on its backspikes.
