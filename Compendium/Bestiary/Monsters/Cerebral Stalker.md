### Traits
***Cocoon (3/Day).*** As an action, a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe with sticky webbing. The webs completely encase the victim, excluding the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The cocooned victim is restrained and anchored by the webs to the cerebral stalker's body. The cocooned creature can, as an action, attempt to break free with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) saving throw. The webbing can be cut open enough for a trapped character to escape with 8 points of slashing damage against AC 10.

***Consume Brain.*** Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 13 ({@dice 2d8+4}) points of piercing damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker reaches its goal: the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A victim slain in this manner reanimates in {@dice 1d4} rounds as a zombie. Typically, the cerebral stalker "tosses" them back up to the surface of the ground so their traveling companions can witness the reanimation and deal with their newly undead friend. Zombies created in this manner are under no one's control.

***Earth Glide.*** A cerebral stalker can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water. Its gliding leaves no sign of its passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. It can bring cocooned victims along with it, but they have no special capacity for breathing while underground. Getting into the ground, however, is not as easy for the cerebral stalker as moving underground. It must spend four moves on four rounds (no dashing) melding into the ground. On the first round, the creature sinks to its knees; on the second round, to its waist; on the third round, to its neck; and on the fourth round, the stalker and any creature it has cocooned disappear completely underground. Melding into the ground does not provoke an opportunity attack. If the cerebral stalker is grappled while sinking into the ground, it must win a Str contest against its grapplers to sink farther that round. Dispel magic or a similar spell cast on a sinking cerebral stalker paralyzes it the same as a hold monster spell. The spot where the cerebral stalker sank radiates magic for one hour.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cerebral stalker bites once and attacks twice with claws, or it uses its fear gaze or cocoon ability.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d10+3}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

***Fear Gaze.*** Ranged Attack: automatic hit, range 30 ft., one creature that can see the cerebral stalker. Hit: Target must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for {@dice 1d4} rounds.
