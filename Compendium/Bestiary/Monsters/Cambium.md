### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.

***Needle Fingers.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 ({@dice 3d10+5}) piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails, the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn, even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.

***Ability Damage (3/Day).*** When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, the cambium can choose to inflict {@dice 1d4} damage to one of the target's ability scores. A greater restoration or greater magic is required to restore this damage.

***Imbalance Humors (3/Day).*** When the target of the cambium's needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of the following effects:Sanguine Flux: The target cannot be healed—naturally or magically—until after their next long rest.Choleric Flux: The target becomes confused (as the spell) for {@dice 3d6} rounds. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.Melancholic Flux: The target is incapacitated for {@dice 1d4} rounds and slowed (as the spell) for {@dice 3d6} rounds. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the duration ends.Phlegmatic Flux: A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw negates this effect. A failed saving throw means the target gains one level of exhaustion which lasts for {@dice 3d6} rounds.
