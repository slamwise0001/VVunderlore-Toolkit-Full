### Traits
***Ethereal Sight.*** The howling echo can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. Vanish by Day. When exposed to natural sunlight, the howling echo fades from existence. Unless it was slain, it reforms the next night in the same place it originally spawned, with full hit points and any ongoing conditions removed.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The howling echo can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult

***terrain.*** It takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Oblivious of its Nature. The howling echo can't use its incorporeal movement knowingly, it only passes through creatures or objects it is unaware of, or if it is forced by an outside source. A howling echo must always try to end its movement in contact with what it deems to be solid ground.

### Actions
***Fangs.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 2d4+3}) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Howl.*** The howling echo emits a boneâ€”chlling howl. Creatures within 60 feet that can hear must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one round. While frightened, a creature is also stunned. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to all howling echoes' howl ability for 1 minute.
