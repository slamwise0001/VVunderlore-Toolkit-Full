***Shifting Floor.*** Whenever the swarm moves into a creature's space or starts its turn in another creature's space, that other creature must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A prone creature must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to stand up in a space occupied by the swarm.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny stone. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Stings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +3} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 ({@dice 4d4}) piercing damage, or 5 ({@dice 2d4}) piercing damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.
