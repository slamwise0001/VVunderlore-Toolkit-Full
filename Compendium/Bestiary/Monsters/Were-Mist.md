### Traits
***Transformation.*** A dominated creature is completely under the were-mists control. At the start of its next turn, as a bonus action, the dominated creature transforms into the hybrid form of a wereboar, wererat, or werewolf (the form is chosen by the were-mist). The transformed creature has the stats and abilities of its new form, but it cant cause lycanthropy. Transformation into a beast heals all lost hit points the same as a long rest, but doesnt affect damaging conditions such as poisoning or disease. The domination and transformation are permanent until the were-mist is killed, is driven off, or leaves voluntarily. The were-mist can be attacked with weapons and with targeted spells without endangering the enveloped creature, but the transformed victim is subject to area affects as normal. The were-mist leaves the transformed creature and seeks a new victim when the transformed creature drops to 10 or fewer hit points. When the were-mist leaves or is killed, the transformed creature immediately transforms back into its normal form, with the same number of hit points it had in were-form. The creature is also stunned until it makes a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn. Killing or knocking out the transformed creature has no effect on the weremist; it simply moves on to another victim.

***Variable CR.*** The challenge rating of a were-mist is the same as the type of beast it transforms victims into; CR 2 for wererats, CR 3 for werewolves, or CR 4 for wereboars. If it transforms victims into more than one type in an encounter, use the highest value.

### Actions
***Domination.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the were-mist enters the target creatures space and the target is dominated and transformed by the were-mist; see Transformation, above.
