### Traits
***Leng Venom.*** A Leng spider's venom causes flesh to blister and rot, reducing the target's Charisma score by 1 point. It also triggers vivid and horrific hallucinations. A poisoned creature suffers the effect of the poisoned condition and must act as if affected by the confusion spell. The confusion effect ends the second time the creature rolls a 9 or 10 at the start of its turn (allowing it to act normally that turn). The poisoned condition persists until after the creature's next long rest, or until the poison is neutralized magically. Lost Charisma can be regained through magic.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A Leng-spider bites once and attacks once with web flails.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d10+3}) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or be poisoned by Leng venom (see above).

***Web Flails.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d10+3}) bludgeoning damage.
