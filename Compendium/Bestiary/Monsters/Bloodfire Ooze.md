### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Burning Blood.*** A creature that touches the ooze, or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) fire damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of wood that hits the ooze burns. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition of wood that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can burn through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood in 1 round.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ooze has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Pseudopods.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 1d8+6}) bludgeoning damage and 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage.

***Flame Burst.*** Any creature within 10 feet of the bloodfire ooze must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 ({@dice 7d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
