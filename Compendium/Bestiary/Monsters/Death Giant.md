### Traits
***Frightful Keening.*** The death giant uses its action to make the guardian souls surrounding it wail in anguish until the giant uses another action to end the keening. Creatures within 60 ft. who can hear the keening must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the death giant until they can no longer hear the keening or are out of range. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the giant's frightful keening for the next 24 hours.

***Guardian Spirits.*** The death giant is constantly surrounded by the souls of its victims, which swirl around it and warn it of danger. The death giant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Initiative rolls. The guardian spirits can be suppressed by a cleric's turn undead, a paladin's turn the unholy ability, or similar abilities. When the death giant is in the area of effect or becomes the target of such an ability, it must make a Charisma saving throw against the ability's save DC. On a failed save the giant's guardian spirits are suppressed for the duration of the ability. While they are suppressed the giant loses its immunity to necrotic damage, does not benefit from the advantage the guardian spirits provide, from steal soul and cannot use its frightful keening. If the frightful keening is already in effect, it immediately ends. The death giant can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Steal Soul.*** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of a death giant must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 18 ({@dice 4d8}) necrotic damage. If a creature dies within 15 feet of the death giant, the death giant absorbs the creature's soul and it becomes one of the giant's guardian spirits. The creature cannot be brought back from the dead, until the death giant is slain.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two melee attacks with its greataxe.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 ({@dice 3d12+8}) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +13} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 30 ({@dice 4d10+8}) bludgeoning damage.
