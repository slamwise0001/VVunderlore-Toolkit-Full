### Traits
***Pheromone.*** If the howler wasp soldier is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by a melee attack, before it dies or falls unconscious, it can as a reaction spray the attacker with a pheromone that incites other howler wasps to violently pursue the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be doused in the pheromone. While the creature is doused, other howler wasps have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. The pheromone fades after 10 minutes, or can be washed off by submerging the creature in water.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The howler wasp soldier makes three melee attacks, one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +57} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) slashing damage.

***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage plus 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until it finishes a long rest.
