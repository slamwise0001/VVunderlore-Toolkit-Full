### Traits
***Immutable Form.*** The clockwork myrmidon is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The clockwork myrmidon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The clockwork myrmidon makes two attacks: two pick attacks or two slam attacks, or one of each.

***Heavy Pick.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ({@dice 2d8+5}) piercing damage.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 1d12+5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Alchemical Flame Jet (Recharge 5—6).*** The clockwork myrmidon can spew a jet of alchemical fire in a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any creature in the path of the jet takes 26 ({@dice 4d12}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

***Grease Spray (Recharge 5—6).*** As a bonus action, the clockwork myrmidon's chest can fire a spray of alchemical grease with a range of 30 feet, covering a 10-by-10 foot square area and turning it into difficult terrain. Each creature standing in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.

***Alchemical Fireball.*** The clockwork myrmidon's alchemical flame reservoir explodes when the construct is destroyed, spraying nearby creatures with burning fuel. A creature within 5 feet of the myrmidon takes 19 ({@dice 3d12}) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. This explosion doesn't occur if the clockwork myrmidon has already fired its alchemical flame jet four times.
