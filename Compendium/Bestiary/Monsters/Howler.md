### Traits
***Howling.*** Creatures other than celestials, elementals, and fiends, that hear the howling of one or more howlers for an hour or longer must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 ( 1d6) psychic damage and gain disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks and saving throws until they finish a long rest without hearing a howler's howling. Creatures exposed to the howling for longer than an hour must repeat the saving throw each full hour. While exposed to continuous howling, a creature cannot benefit from short rests and a long rest instead has the effects of a short rest. A creature, that is reduced to 0 hit points by this psychic damage, falls unconscious and is automatically stable, not taking any further damage from the howling until it is above 0 hit points again. Hit and Run. If the howler hits a creature with its quills, that creature can't make an opportunity against the Howler this turn.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The howler makes two melee attacks, one with its bite and one with its quills.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ( 2d6+4) piercing damage.

***Quills.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ( 3d4+4) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or  1d4 quills break off the howler and remain lodged in the target's flesh. While lodged in the creature's flesh, the quills impose disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity and Strength checks and saving throws the creature makes. As an action, a creature can remove howler quills from itself or another creature within arm's reach by making a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If the check fails, the quills are still removed, but the target takes 3 ( 1d6) slashing damage per quill that was removed.
