### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The githyanki makes two silver greatsword attacks.

***Silver Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( 2d6+6) slashing damage + 10 ( 3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
