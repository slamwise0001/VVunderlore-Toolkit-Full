### Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** Akyishigal has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Summon Demon (1/Day).*** Akyishigal can summon a chasme demon. The chasme appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Akyishigal, acts as an ally of Akyishigal, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Akyishigal makes four claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 2d10+5}) slashing damage.

***Cloak of Swarms (Recharge 5â€”6).*** Akyishigal can emit a cloud of flying, stinging insects from his mouth, his eyes, and the tears in his skin. This cloud surrounds him to a depth of 5 feet. When the cloak is active, all attacks against him are made with disadvantage, and Akyishigal can see in all directions (through the insects' eyes). Any living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of Akyishigal takes 11 ({@dice 2d10}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@dice 3d6}) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the character is also poisoned for 1 hour. The swarm lasts for 5 rounds; it dissipates instantly if Akyishigal takes 30 or more damage from a nonweapon attack that he doesn't have resistance to. While poisoned by the Cloak of Swarms, a character emits a stench of decomposition. All uncontrolled vermin attack that character on sight and in preference to other targets.

### Legendary Actions
***Teleport.*** Akyishigal may teleport within line of sight.

***Skitter.*** Akyishigal combines an attack with a move up to 20 feet as if using a withdraw action, and is not subject to attacks of opportunity.

***Spellcasting (Costs 2 Actions).*** Akyishigal casts insect plague from its innate spellcasting ability.
