***Breath Weapon (Recharge 5â€”6).*** An alehouse drake can burp a cloud of intoxicating gas in a 15-foot cone. A creature caught in the cloud becomes poisoned for 1 minute and must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for {@dice 1d6} rounds.

***Discombobulating Touch.*** An alehouse drake can make a touch attack that grants its target +3 to Dexterity-based skill checks and melee attacks but also induces confusion as per the spell. This effect lasts for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw negates this effect.
