### Traits
***False Life.*** If damage reduces the swarm husk to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the swarm husk drops to 1 hit point instead. If the swarm husk fails the saving throw, it dies immediately, it can not be incapacitated and attempt to make death saving throws.

***Worm Infestation.*** A creature that touches the swarm husk must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, or take 10 ({@dice 4d4}) piercing damage, or 5 ({@dice 2d4}) piercing damage if the swarm husk has half of its hit points or fewer.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The swarm husk makes two fist attacks.

***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d6+4}) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take an additional 10 ({@dice 4d4}) piercing damage or 5 ({@dice 2d4}) piercing damage if the swarm husk has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Spew Worms (recharge 5â€”6).*** The swarm husk regurgitates a mass of parasite worms in a 15 foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 ({@dice 4d8}) piercing damage, or 9 ({@dice 2d8}) piercing damage if the swarm husk has half of its hit points or fewer, on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
