### Traits
***Shapechanger.*** The dream eater can use its turn to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in all forms. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dream eater makes one bite attack and one claw attack.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12).

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 ({@dice 4d10+2}) slashing damage.

***Dream Eater's Caress.*** A creature that ends its turn grappled by a dream eater is restrained until the end of its next turn, it takes 5 ({@dice 1d4+3}) psychic damage, and the dream eater gains the same number of temporary hit points.

***Lotus Scent (Recharge 6).*** The dream eater secretes an oily chemical that most creatures find intoxicating. All living creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison or be poisoned for {@dice 2d4} rounds. While poisoned this way, the creature is stunned. Creatures that successfully save are immune to that dream eater's lotus scent for 24 hours.

***Waking Dreams (1/Day).*** Every creature within 20 feet of the dream eater must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Those that fail enter waking dreams and are confused (as the spell) for 6 rounds. On turns when the creature can act normally (rolls 9 or 10 for the confusion effect), it can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, and the effect ends early on a successful save.
