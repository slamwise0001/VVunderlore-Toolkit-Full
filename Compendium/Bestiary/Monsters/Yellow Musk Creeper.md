### Traits
***Create Yellow Musk Zombie.*** A creature that is charmed by a yellow musk creeper and reduced to Intelligence 0 becomes a yellow musk zombie under the control of the creeper that created it. The transformation takes 1 hour. If the yellow musk creeper is slain before the transformation is complete, the transformation can be prevented by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or comparable poison-negating magic.

***Rejuvenation.*** A yellow musk creeper can be killed only if its root is dug up and burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Reducing the creeper to 0 hit points puts it out of commission so that its root can be dug up safely. The root is a Small bulb with AC 5 and 10 hit points. If the root is not destroyed, the plant regrows in two weeks.


### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A yellow musk creeper attacks twice with tendrils and sprays pollen once.

***Tendril.*** Melee Attack:  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 ( 1d4+2) piercing damage. If the target is charmed by the yellow musk creeper, it also loses  1d4 Intelligence points; see Create Yellow Musk Zombie, above.

***Pollen.*** Ranged Attack: automatic hit, range 30 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated and charmed by the yellow musk creeper for  1d4 minutes. Charmed creatures must approach the yellow musk creeper and dont resist its attacks; the creepers tendril attacks have tactical advantage against them.
