### Traits
***Absorb Arcane Energy.*** Any arcane spell targeted at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed into its body. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell would otherwise deal; nondamaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell level. Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they affect the arcanoplasm. The arcanoplasm can't absorb magic from spells that it cast itself using arcane spell mimicry, and it can't absorb divine magic, which affects it normally.

***Amorphous.*** An arcanoplasm can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty.

***Arcanesense.*** An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane spellcaster within 100 feet. This ability is not blocked by any material.

***Arcane Spell Mimicry.*** As an action, an arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell of 4th level or lower cast within 30 feet of it on its next turn. The spell takes effect as if cast by a 7th-level sorcerer (spell save DC 13, {@hit +6} to hit with spell attacks) and requires no components. Because of its innately magical nature, an arcanoplasm adds both its Con and Cha modifiers to concentration checks when it takes damage.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The arcanoplasm slams once and constricts once.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+2}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage, and the target is grappled.

***Constricted.*** Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit (one creature already grappled by the arcanoplasm at the start of the arcanoplasm's turn). Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+2}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) acid damage.
