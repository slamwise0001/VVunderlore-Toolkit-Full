### Traits
***Armored Skull.*** Only the tunnel worms head has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Attacks against any other portion of its body arent affected by that resistance.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 ({@dice 3d8+5}) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.

***Severing Bite.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the tunnel worm at the start of the tunnel worms turn. Hit: 27 ({@dice 4d10+5}) slashing damage and the targets armor class is reduced by 2. A successful DC 15 Dexterity or Strength saving throw reduces damage by half and reduces armor loss to 1. Armor reduced to AC 10 is destroyed. If the target isnt wearing armor, its armor class is not affected in any case.
