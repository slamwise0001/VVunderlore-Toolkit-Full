### Traits
***Teleport Other (1/Day).*** Once per day as an attack, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to another location. A targeted creature resists teleporting with a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Affected creatures are teleported a random distance ({@dice 1d10} x 100 feet) in a random direction. Roll separately for each creature that fails its saving throw. A teleported creature arrives in an open space as close as possible to the determined destination spot. A creature can teleport into midair rather than onto a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that teleports into midair takes falling damage normally unless it has some means to prevent falling.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A crypt thing attacks twice with claws.

***Claw.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d8+2}) slashing damage.
