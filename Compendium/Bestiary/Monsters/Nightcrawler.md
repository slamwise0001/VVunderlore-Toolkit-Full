### Traits
***Blend with Shadows.*** The nightshade has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.

***Desecrating Aura.*** Other undead creatures have resistance to radiant damage and advantage on attack rolls and saving throws while within 20 feet of the nightshade.

***Magic Resistance.*** The nightshade has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sunlight Aversion.*** While in natural sunlight (a daylight spell does not suffice), the nightshade has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nightcrawler can cast cone of cold. It then makes two melee attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 26 ({@dice 3d10+10}) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the nightcrawler can't use its bite against another target.

***Stinger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +17} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 ({@dice 3d6+10}) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or become poisoned. While poisoned, the creature is incapacitated. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Swallow.*** The nightcrawler makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the nightcrawler. The creature takes 17 ({@dice 5d6}) necrotic damage at the start of each of the nightcrawler's turns and must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by the necroctic damage taken. The creature dies if thiseffect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. If the nightcrawler takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the nightcrawler must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the nightcrawler. If the nightcrawler dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Summon Undead (1/Night).*** The nightshade calls upon undead creatures lurking in the darkness nearby. Within {@dice 1d6} rounds, {@dice 1d6+6 }Shadows (see Monster Manual p. 269) each arrive in an unoccupied space anywhere within 60 feet of the nightshade, serving the nightshade as allies.
