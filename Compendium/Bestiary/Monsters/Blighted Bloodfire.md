### Traits
***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Burning Blood.*** A creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) fire damage and 4 ({@dice 1d8}) necrotic damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of wood that hits the ooze burns. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition of wood that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can burn through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood in 1 round.

***Necrotic Aura.*** A creature other than a construct or undead that starts its turn within 10 feet of a blighted bloodfire takes 4 ({@dice 1d8}) points of necrotic damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ooze has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The bloodfire ooze makes two melee attacks with its pseudopods and fires its necrotic blast. The necrotic blast does not suffer disadvantage from an enemy that is threatening the ooze.

***Pseudopods.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 1d8+6}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) fire damage.

***Necrotic blast.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 4d4}) necrotic damage.

***Flame Burst.*** Any creature within 10 feet of the bloodfire ooze must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 ({@dice 7d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
