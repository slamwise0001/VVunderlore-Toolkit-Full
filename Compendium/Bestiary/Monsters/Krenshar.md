***Multiattack.*** The krenshar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) slashing damage.

***Frightening Roar.*** Creatures other than krenshar within 60 feet of a krenshar when it roars must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or fall prone and become frightened for 1 minute. Creatures cannot stand from prone while frightened by the krenshar. At the end of their turns, affected creatures can attempt another DC 11 Charisma saving throw to end the frightened condition. When a creature makes the saving throw or the effect ends, the creature is immune to all krensharsâ€™ Frightening Roar for the next 24 hours.
