### Traits
***Protected from Good.*** Good-aligned creatures have tactical disadvantage when attacking a gnarlwood, and it can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by a good-aligned creature.

***Rend.*** If a single target is hit by two of the gnarlwood's clawed branch attacks in a single turn, that target automatically takes an additional 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) slashing damage and is grappled.

***Unhallowed Aura.*** When an undead creature within 30 feet of a gnarlwood attacks or makes a saving throw, it can roll {@dice 1d4} along with its d20 and add the results together.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A gnarlwood attacks four times with clawed branches, or it uses a spell-like ability.

***Clawed Branch.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 ({@dice 2d8+6}) slashing damage.
