### Traits
***Stench.*** A witherstench has a putrid stench that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except witherstenches) that start their turn within 30 feet of a witherstench must make a successful DC 8 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Even after leaving the affected area, the creature has tactical disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. Creatures that save successfully are immune to this stench until after their next long rest. Spells and effects that neutralize poison are effective against stench. Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect, and those that are resistant to poison have tactical advantage on their saving throw.

### Actions
***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 slashing damage.
