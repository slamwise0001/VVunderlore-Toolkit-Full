Each gem stores one magic spell; the wearer of the necklace can use an action (or reaction for counterspell) to cast one of the spells. Spells are cast at their lowest level, using the caster's attack bonus and saving throw DC. The necklace recovers one expended charge per hour when worn by Teratashia; it doesn't recover charges when worn by anyone else. arcane lock (x2) bestow curse (x2) cloudkill (x2) cone of cold (x4) counterspell (x2) cure wounds (x4) fireball (x2) hypnotic pattern (x2) knock (x2) mirror image (x2) witch bolt (x2)
