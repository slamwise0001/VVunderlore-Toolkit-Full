### Traits
***Agile Grappler.*** A volt uses its Dexterity (Acrobatics) score to oppose attempts to escape from its grapple. The volt cant move a creature it grapples, but it moves with the grappled creature. If the grapple is broken, the volt immediately moves 5 feet into an adjacent, empty space.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) piercing damage and the volt enters the targets space and grapples the target. The volt cant use its bite attack while it is grappling a creature.

***Tail Slap.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the volt at the start of the volts turn. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) lightning damage. A creature reduced to 0 hp by this attack is unconscious and stable, not dying.
