### Traits
***Incorporeal.*** A brume can move through solid objects and living creatures at half-speed. If it ends its turn inside another object or creature, it takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage. This damage is not reduced by the brume's resistance to nonmagical damage.

***Lifesense.*** A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature within 120 feet, and it knows how close to death the creature is.

***Memory Loss.*** A living creature struck by a brume's claw attack must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. Failure indicates the creature is affected as if by a confusion spell for {@dice 1d4} hours and it forgets everything that happened in the preceding {@dice 1d6} hours. If the target is a spellcaster, he or she also loses spell slots equal in value to the sum of those two die rolls (d4+d6). The spell slots are treated exactly as if they'd been used to cast spells already. The largest spell slots possible must be lost; e.g., a 6th-level wizard who forgets five spell slots must lose a 3rd-level slot (the largest possible) and a 2nd-level slot (to reach five slots lost). The confusion effect can be removed with a dispel magic spell, but the memories of the last few hours are gone forever. Lost spell slots are recovered normally through rest.

***Natural Invisibility.*** A brume is always invisible in fog, smoke, or mist. It can't become visible in such an environment.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The brume attacks twice with claws.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) slashing damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or lose one point of Charisma. The target is also subject to memory loss (see above).

***Misty Surroundings (Recharge 6).*** The brume can create an area of fog around itself as if it cast the fog cloud spell. It does not need to concentrate to maintain the fog. The fog cloud has a radius of 40 feet.
