### Traits
***Immutable Form.*** The algorith is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The algorith makes two logic razor attacks.

***Logic Razor.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 31 ({@dice 4d12+5}) force damage.

***Cone of Negation (Recharge 5â€”6).*** An algorith can project a cone of null energy. Targets inside the 30 foot cone take 42 ({@dice 12d6}) force damage and suffer the effect of a dispel magic spell. A successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage to half and negates the dispel magic effect on that target.

***Reality Bomb (5/Day).*** The algorith can summon forth a tiny rune of law and throw it as a weapon. Any creature within 30 feet of the square where the reality bomb lands takes 21 ({@dice 6d6}) force damage and is stunned until the start of the algorith's next turn. A target that makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw takes half damage and isn't stunned.
