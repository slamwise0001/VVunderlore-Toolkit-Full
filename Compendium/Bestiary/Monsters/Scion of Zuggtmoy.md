### Traits
***Infection (1/Day).*** As a bonus action, the scion releases a spore cloud. Creatures within 10 feet of the infector must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 9 ({@dice 2d8}) necrotic damage. A creature that failed its saving throw takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Actions
***Tendrils.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ({@dice 2d6+3}) bludgeoning damage plus 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the overgrowth can't attack another target with its tendrils.

***Overgrowth.*** A creature grappled by the overgrowth becomes restrained and the grapple ends. While restrained, the creature takes 23 ({@dice 5d8}) poison damage at the beginning of each of its turns. An affected creature may use its action to attempt a DC 14 Strength saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
