### Traits
***Charge.*** A quadricorn does extra damage with a horn attack if it moved at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target of the attack. It can trample another target during this move. If the horn attack hits, the target creature takes an extra 13 ({@dice 3d8}) piercing damage and must make a successful DC 14 Strength check or be pushed 5 feet away from the quadricorn and knocked prone.

***Magic Horns.*** A quadricorns horns are treated as magic weapons.

***Trample.*** As it moves, a quadricorn can trample one Medium or smaller creature. The target creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw when the quadricorn moves adjacent. If the saving throw succeeds, the target can move 5 feet to either side, the quadricorn continues moving, and the trample attack has no effect. If the saving throw fails, the target is knocked prone, takes 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) bludgeoning damage, and the quadricorn can move through the targets space but cant end its turn there.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A quadricorn attacks twice with its horns. The two attacks must be made against separate targets.

***Horns.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) magic, piercing damage.
