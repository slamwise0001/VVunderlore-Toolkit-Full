### Traits
***Ambush.*** A tazelwurm has tactical advantage on initiative rolls. Against an opponent that hasnt yet taken a turn in the current combat, the tazelwurm has tactical advantage on attack rolls and each of its attacks causes an additional 3 ({@dice 1d6}) damage.

***Frightening Exuviation.*** If an attack that hits a tazelwurm includes fire damage, the tazelwurm takes no damage. Instead, its skin, scales, and flesh burn away in just a few seconds, reducing the tazelwurm to a living skeleton. A creature viewing this (other than another tazelwurm) must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for {@dice 1d4} rounds. A creature that saves successfully cant be affected by this ability until after its next long rest. If the tazelwurm survives the encounter, it regenerates all of its flesh and organs in 24 hours.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A tazelwurm bites once and attacks once with claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 ({@dice 1d6+2}) slashing damage.
