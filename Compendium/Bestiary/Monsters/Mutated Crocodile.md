### Traits
***Drink Blood.*** If a mutated crocodile has a living creature grappled, it can use a bonus action to have the eel tentacles on its face drain the grappled creature’s blood. This reduces the maximum hits points of the creature by 3. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Hold Breath.*** The crocodile can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d8+2}) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the crocodile can’t bite another target.
