***Electricity Sense.*** The shocker lizard automatically detects electrical charges within 100 feet, such as lightning spells and abilities being used or creatures and machines using electricity.

***Stunning Shock.*** As a bonus action the shocker lizard can deliver an electric shock to a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become stunned for 1 round. If the target has 13 ({@dice 3d8}) hit points or fewer it falls unconscious for 1 hour. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an an action to shake or slap it awake.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 ({@dice 1d4}) piercing damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) lightning damage.

***Lethal Shock.*** If two or more shocker lizards within 20 feet of each other are working together by using this action, at the end of the round they create a lethal discharge. Creatures within 20 feet of one contributing shocker lizard must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 round and taking 9 ({@dice 2d8}) lightning damage for each contributing shocker lizard (to a maximum of 54 ({@dice 12d8}) lightning damage) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
