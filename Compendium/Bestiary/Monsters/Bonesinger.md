### Traits
***Bardic Inspiration (3/Day).*** As a bonus action, the bonesinger can inspire one creature other than itself. The creature gains a bardic inspiration die, a d8. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll or saving throw it makes. The creature adds this die after the roll is made but before success or failure is determined. A creature can only have one bardic inspiration die at a time.

***Cooperative Magic.*** The bonesinger aids an allied bonesinger in casting a spell or using its Wind of Death action. Saving throws against the ally's spell or Wind of Death have disadvantage, and spell attack rolls the ally makes have advantage. The bonesinger can only use this ability by using the Ready action to trigger when an allied bonesinger within 5 feet of the bonesinger casts a spell or uses its Wind of Death ability.

***Singing Bones.*** As long as it is not affected by magical silence or submerged in water, the bonesinger has advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks and disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth checks).

### Actions
***Rapier.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ({@dice 1d8+4}) piercing damage.

***Wind of Death.*** The bonesinger summons a deathly magical wind, smelling of rotting corpses. The effect of this ability is identical to a gust of wind spell but creatures caught in the area must also succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
