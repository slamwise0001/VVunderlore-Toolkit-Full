### Traits
***Dominate Apes.*** A hanu-naga can dance in a writhing, hypnotic way that charms apes, baboons, mandrills, and other primates with Intelligence scores of 5 or less (including humanoids). It can perform this dance even while fighting. When it dances, all primates within 60 feet are charmed by the hanu-naga, and all other primates within one mile are drawn to the hanu-naga's location at top speed. It can have up to 20 creatures charmed this way at one time. The hanu-naga has telepathic communication with the creatures it's charmed, and they do their utmost to carry out its simple commands as if they are affected by a dominate beast spell. Its control lasts for as long as the hanu-naga continues dancing. Humanoids of Intelligence 5 or less who are within 60 feet of a dancing hanu-naga must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw to avoid the hanu-naga's charm. One successful save renders a humanoid immune to this charm effect for 24 hours.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 ({@dice 1d8+3}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw. A creature has tactical disadvantage on this saving throw if it is grappled by the hanu-naga.

***Constrict.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+3}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.
