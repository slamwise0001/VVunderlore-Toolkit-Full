### Traits
***Keen Sight.*** The nothic has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The nothic makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Rotting Gaze.*** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Weird Insight.*** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the nothicâ€™s Wisdom (Insight) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed.
