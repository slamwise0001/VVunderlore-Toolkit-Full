### Traits
***Consume.*** As a bonus action, the seszrath makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the seszrath, and it takes 21 ({@dice 6d6}) necrotic damage at the start of each of the seszrath's turns. If the seszrath takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the seszrath must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the seszrath. If the seszrath dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The seszrath makes two melee attacks with its tentacle arms.

***Tentacle Arm.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 ({@dice 3d8+6}) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). The seszrath has two tentacle arms, each of which can grapple a single Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the seszrath can't make a tentacle arm attack against another target.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ({@dice 3d6+6}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@dice 1d8}) necrotic damage.

***Vicious Throw.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: {@hit +10} to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ({@dice 1d6+6}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet of distance between the seszrath and the target. The seszrath can only use this attack while grappling a Medium or smaller creature. It throws the grappled creature at the target. The grapple ends and the thrown creature is placed in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target (target's choice) and automatically takes the damage of this attack even if the attack misses.
