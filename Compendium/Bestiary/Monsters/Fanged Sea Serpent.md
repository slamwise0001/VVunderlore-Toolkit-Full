### Traits
***Impale.*** When a fanged sea serpent delivers a critical hit, it drives its fangs completely through the creatures body or limbs. An impaled creature is grappled and takes 10 ({@dice 1d12+4}) piercing damage at the start of each of the fanged sea serpents turns. It also takes 6 ({@dice 1d12}) piercing damage when it escapes from the grapple. A fanged sea serpent can have up to one Medium or two Small creatures impaled at one time.

### Actions
***Bite.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 ({@dice 1d12+4}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@dice 2d6}) poison damage. The target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for {@dice 1d4} rounds. The fanged sea serpent scores a critical hit if its attack roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20; see Impale, above.
