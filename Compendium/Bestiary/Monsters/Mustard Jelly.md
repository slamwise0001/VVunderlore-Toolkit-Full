### Traits
***Blind.*** A mustard jelly has no eyes, so it is immune to effects that depend on sight such as illusions or gaze attacks.

***Divide.*** As an action, a mustard jelly with more than 10 hit points can split itself into two identical jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points (rounded down). For the first minute (10 rounds) after dividing, the newly divided jellies have speed 40 feet.

***Energy Absorption.*** When a mustard jelly is targeted by a magic missile spell or when it would take lightning damage, it takes no damage but instead gains temporary hit points equal to the damage the attack should have caused.

***Poison Aura.*** A mustard jelly exudes a poisonous vapor. Every creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of a mustard jelly must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained for as long as it remains within 10 feet of any mustard jelly and for {@dice 1d4} rounds afterward. This is a poison effect, not physical restraint.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** A mustard jelly makes one slam attack, plus up to five constriction attacks against grappled creatures.

***Slam.*** Melee Attack: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@dice 1d6}) acid damage and the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be grappled. A mustard jelly can have up to five creatures grappled at once and still make slam attacks; it can grapple a sixth creature, but it can't make slam attacks while it has six creatures grappled.

***Constrict.*** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the mustard jelly at the start of the jelly's turn. Hit: 9 ({@dice 2d6+2}) bludgeoning damage plus 5 ({@dice 1d10}) acid damage.
