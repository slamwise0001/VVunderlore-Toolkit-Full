### Traits
***Sculpt Spells.*** When the evoker casts an evocation spell that forces other creatures it can see to make a saving throw, it can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell. If a successful save means a chosen creature would take half damage from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.


### Actions
***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 ( 1d6-1) bludgeoning damage, or 3 ( 1d8-1) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
