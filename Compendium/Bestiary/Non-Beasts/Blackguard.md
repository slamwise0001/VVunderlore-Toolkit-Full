***Shortbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack:  +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ( 1d6+2) piercing damage.

***Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The blackguard exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a frightened target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the tar get can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
