### Traits
***Ethereal Jaunt.*** As a bonus action, the spider can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa. 

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. 

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
