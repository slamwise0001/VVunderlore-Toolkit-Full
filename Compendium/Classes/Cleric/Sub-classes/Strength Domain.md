### Level 1

#### Strength Domain (PSA)
"The worthy shall hone a strong body that can withstand the boundless energies of the afterlife."
It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlifeâ€”but to his mind, the words themselves don't matter. Strength can't be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see.
