#### Knowledge Domain (PSA)
"The worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind that can perceive the wonders beyond imagination that wait in the afterlife."
Kefnet's task is to pass on this teaching of the God-Pharaoh and elucidate its meaning. He teaches that the afterlife will be inhabited only by those who have proved by their wits that they are worthy of dwelling in the glorious presence of the God-Pharaoh. He trains acolytes and initiates to push their limits and challenge their mental capacity with spells of ever-greater power.
Kefnet's domain is identical to the Knowledge domain in the Player's Handbook.
