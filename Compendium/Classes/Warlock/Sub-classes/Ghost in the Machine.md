# Ghost in the Machine

**Source:** UAModernMagic

You have made a bargain for power granted by an entity that you believe to be completely digital. Whether it is a rogue AI or the spirit of a deceased hacker, the Ghost in the Machine is capable of feats that defy explanation.

### Level 1
---
##### **Expanded Spell List**
The Ghost in the Machine lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. You gain the on/off cantrip, and the following new spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
Spells marked with an asterisk can be found in Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic.

##### **Bonus Proficiency**
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools.

##### **Information Surge**
At 1st level, you gain the ability to temporarily render computerized devices inoperable. As an action, you can target a computerized device within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases to function until the end of your next turn. If the targeted device is not held or used by a creature, the DM makes a special saving throw for the device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. Certain shielded devices might negate the disadvantage, at the DM's determination.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Level 6
---
##### **Wire Walk**
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to travel short distances over electrical wires, data lines, or telephone cables. As a bonus action, you can touch a device or socket connected to a hardwired network and teleport along this network to another device or socket within your line of sight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Level 10
---
##### **Personal Encryption**
Beginning at 10th level, you have learned to apply your innate knowledge of encryption to your thoughts, memories, and presence. You have advantage on saving throws against [[scrying]], thought detection, or any other method of magically learning your whereabouts or reading your thoughts. For any such effect that does not grant you a saving throw but which requires the creature targeting you to make an ability check, the check is made with disadvantage.

### Level 14
---
##### **Technovirus**
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's body with living circuitry. You can use an action to make a melee attack against a humanoid creature using your spell attack modifier. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC as a techno-organic virus quickly spreads through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, you can use an action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the [[command]] spell. The target makes its saving throw against your [[command]] with disadvantage. You can issue this [[command]] at any time while the target remains infected.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, at which point the target is cured of the technovirus. The infection can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell.
