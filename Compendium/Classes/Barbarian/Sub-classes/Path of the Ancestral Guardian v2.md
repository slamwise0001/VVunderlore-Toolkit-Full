# Path of the Ancestral Guardian v2

**Source:** UARevisedSubclasses

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger on in the world as mighty spirits who can guide and protect the living. When barbarians who follow this path rage, they cross the barrier into the spirit world and call on these guardian spirits for aid.
Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians fight to protect their tribes and their allies. With the spirits' help, they can hinder their foes even as they strike powerful blows against them.
In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell epic sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

### Level 3
---
##### **Ancestral Protectors**
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you rage. These warriors distract a foe you designate and hinder its attempts to evade you. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of these warriors. Until the start of your next turn or until your rage ends, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you, and creatures other than you have resistance to the damage of the creature's attacks.
