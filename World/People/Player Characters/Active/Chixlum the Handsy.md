## Fun Facts!
- Fellatia has never been romantic with another Tabaxi.
- Fellatia knew of Captain Quinn and the history of kidnapping Tabaxi. Uh oh!
- Incredibly allergic to cows
- Has silvery fur but actually has fully brown fur but takes herbs to make it silver. Silverleaf and silverberry
- Very good at fishing but was barred from all international fishing competitions because she used her magic to turn her claws into fish hooks and was caught. 
- Piss attracts enemies. Cat stuff. SHe has to be really careful when she pees.
- Fellatia sometimes has a poison scratch but it's super rando and she can't figure it out.
- Oldest of 13 across 4 litters. Over 100 nieces and nephews. 103 to be exact
- FUUUJNNN FACT
- Fellatia is a very accomplished pickpocket but didn't want to steal Tilly's thunder but would still steal something from tilly every morning but then put it back because she felt bad.## Appearance
*Physical description, notable features, and anything special about the character's appearance.*
- Fellatia was extremely attracted to Lira. Felt a connection like never before.
- Is lactose intolerant. 
- Published a since-banned book called "The Stuffed Kitty," a cross-species intructional sex tome. 
- Throughout her life has only very occasionally suffered bouts of alopecia and has lost all her fur. Hasn't happened in over two decades. Hopefully the stress of the mine doesn't make her loose tufts.## Personality Traits
*Key traits, motivations, and quirks of the character.*
- Really enjoys seafood but is allergic to mollusks. 
- Alopecia is really starting to show. Being in the dark and underground is not good, especially the stress and stuff.## Backstory
*Character backstory, origins, and any important life events.*
- Salve for alopecia: it's called tiger balm. 
- Despite the fact the Fellatia doesn't love to swim, she's a champ at holding her breath. She won a contest holding her breath for 22 minutes.## Current Story Threads
- Knew about Captain Nadia Quinn being a part of a Tabaxi-enslavement ring
- PULL TOWARDS THE DARKNESS - Fellatia failed her check at the mirrored pond in Tungurd Forest and saw the demons eyes. She'll always be drawn to death. **MAKE IT A CHOICE THOUGH**.
	- Certain doors should appear as the black breathing door from the mausoleum 
- When she was in prison, she was on a work crew that worked in the snow for a year staight so she has bad memories of the snow but now shes got good new piss memories from this trip.
- During Fellatia's FIRST prison stint, she directed an all-female acapella group.## Goals & Ambitions
*Long-term character goals or aspirations.*
- 1. Fellatia was born with a second vestigial tail. Removed.
2. Fellatia was born with an extra claw on each front paw. ITS A LIE.
3. Once won a chili dog eating contest.
- Her father was actually the mayor of the Tabaxi home town and was the seventh in a line of Bloodwhisper mayors. Felltaia was expected to follow in his footsteps but "abdicated" the mayoral throne so she's not well liked. Bummer## Allies & Enemies
*Important allies, NPCs, or enemies in the character‚Äôs life.*

## Inventory
*Track important items, loot, or equipment.*

## Notes
*Anything else worth remembering.*
