  Known Issues:
  
- [ ] Links for Difficult Terrain are formatted dumbly and point nowhere
- [ ] (2024) Challenge Rating parsing broken on SOME CR 0 creatures and beasts
- [ ] Links and references to random entries, loot tables, and bespoke rule entries on Items do not work
- [ ] Spell's like "Enlarge/Reduce" don't work because that's not what the spell is named in the Compendium (Enlarge-Reduce) for computery reasons
- [ ] Ring of Resistance is wicked invisible, like where did it even go?
