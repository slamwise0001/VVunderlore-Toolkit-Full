- Quick fix for the busted Adventure Hub template. Now the Player Characters and Takeaways tables, uh... exist. My bad. Will share fixes for already-made adventure hubs soon.
- Added over 4000 beasts and the Fantasy Statblock plugin (will affect fresh installs only but I'll share a file for everyone else soon.
  
  Known Issues:
  
- Links for Difficult Terrain are formatted dumbly and point nowhere
- (2024) Challenge Rating parsing broken on SOME CR 0 creatures and beasts
- Links and references to random entries, loot tables, and bespoke rule entries on Items do not work
- Spell's like "Enlarge/Reduce" don't work because that's not what the spell is named in the Compendium (Enlarge-Reduce) for computery reasons
- Ring of Resistance is wicked invisible, like where did it even go? 
- Properties seem to want to be open or closed at random on new notes. May add a VVunderlore toggle for those wanting a non-invasive experience.
- 2024 compendium files show a bunch of 2014 content! OH NO. This is because all the data is scraped from 5e.tools (to avoid any legal crap on my end) and they keep 2014 info in the 2024 json files so the site can link/reference "replaced" content in the new edition and the parsers catch that 2014 data first because it's literally just listed first in the file. ACK.
