# Welcome to the VVunderlore Toolkit... 
...an environment for writing and running TTRPGs in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Inside you'll find an efficient file structure, templates for creating new compendiums items, and several modules and tools to make all the writing and gamerunning bit easier.

# Changelog

## v1.1 - 3.24.25
##### NEW THINGS AND FIXES:
- **Player Character Functionality (I am... fully functional)! 
	- New player character note template along with fillable form. Is it perfect? No. End of note.
	- Auto-creates the player dash note for the Party Overview 
		- Expanded to 10 player buttons so you just have to change the name and the filepath (if you have more than 10 players I feel like you'll also be able to figure out how to add more buttons)
	- New Player Character button on the Omninomicron
- Cleaner download of the full environment:
	- **Plugins and forms now included in the vault download. No installation or form importing required!** THIS IS THE BIGGER ONE, HONESTLY
	- ncluded *.gitkeep* files to preserve empty folders so no missing directories
- Updated forms and templates to prevent ENOENT and ENODIR errors on PC (I think)
- Fixed Creature Creation template.
- Added a download for just the compendium and compendium templates to the website
- Quality of life improvements to some forms
- More consistent metadata across note types. Hot stuff!
##### KNOWN ISSUES:
- Party overview creates a blank line every time you switch between players. It's a fun little game.
- Issue with NPC Statblock gen. Not concerned.
- More that I forgot or don't know about yet.
- Speed metadata on new creature notes is bad.
