# The VVunderlore Toolkit version 1.0

##### You're here because you downloaded the full vault. Hooray! This is absolutely the most functional version of all of my tools and templates right now. However, that doesn't mean there isn't super useful stuff on the [website](http://vvunderlore.com) too.  

In here are all the tools (and more[^1]) that I've built for my TTRPG adventure writing, world building, and game running. There are some examples of players, items, etc., in here to help you get a sense of how things are going to look and work before you start plugging your own creations in. But you should feel free to delete it all when you're ready (especially the example adventure).  

It turned out a bit more 5e than I would have liked but I'll work on that. 

## The First Step
Visit the website to find info on the [forms](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Compendium+Templates/All+Template+Forms) and [plugins](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Plugins) you need to install to make this whole thing work as well as documentation on each tool or 
[template](https://vvunderlore.com/toolkit/compendium_templates). You'll also find useful information about Obsidian like the [Quick Start Guide](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Quick+Start+Guide) and [Glossary of Obsidian Stuff](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Basics+and+Glossary). At least do the forms and plugins before you do anything else!

>[!success] **When you're ready, head over to the [[Omninomicon]] and create your first adventure!**

### Changes and Updates
I'm constantly expanding and evolving this toolkit so I'll try to keep announcements as regular and loud as I can. If that fails, most notes  on the website have a "Roadmap and Changelog" box at the top that I try to remember to update. I'm not quite sure how updates to the full vault will go. We'll cross the bridge later.

I'll also post regular updates, explanations, tutorials, and rants about the state of the world on my TikTok: **[@son_of_pizza](http://tiktok.com/@son_of_pizza)**.
