# Welcome to the VVunderlore Toolkit!

In here are all the tools (and more[^1]) that I've built for my TTRPG adventure writing, world building, and game running. There are some examples of players, items, etc., in here to help you get a sense of how things are going to look and work before you start plugging your own creations in. 

## Introducing the new VVunderlore Toolkit Plugin

This plugin (which you just installed) will allow me to update the toolkit from afar, bringing you fixes and improvements with only the click of a button on your part. So, be sure to keep an eye on that plugin and update the toolkit when it tells you to!

The plugin also has a number of other little functions that give you some more control over how the toolkit is managed in your vault. For a breakdown of all the abilities, you can visit the [plugin page](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Toolkit+Plugin). 

## The First Step
The toolkit is ready to be populated with all your great ideas and adventures and disappointingly short session notes.  So start creating! If you're new to obsidian and still need to get your sea legs, you'll find useful information in  the [Quick Start Guide](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Quick+Start+Guide) and [Glossary of Obsidian Stuff](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/Obsidian+Basics+and+Glossary) on the website. 

>[!success] **When you're ready, head over to the [[Omninomicon]] and create your first adventure!**

### Changes and Updates
I'm constantly expanding and evolving this toolkit so I'll try to keep announcements as regular and loud as I can. If that fails, the front page of the [website](https://vvunderlore.com/Toolkit/VVelcome_) has a changelog and that I'll try to remember to update. 

##### I'll also post regular updates, explanations, tutorials, and rants about the state of the world on my **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vvunderlore)**!
